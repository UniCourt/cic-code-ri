     </h3>
     <p>
      This chapter shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes of it and to apportion the state into senatorial districts in compliance with the requirements of the United States Constitution. It is intended that the senatorial districts described in this chapter completely encompass all the area within the state and contain all the citizens resident in the state. It is further intended that the apportionment and districting provided for in this chapter results in the creation of districts containing substantially equal population. It is also intended that no senatorial district shall include any of the area included within the description of any other senatorial district. If the districts described in this chapter do not carry out the purposes of them because of patent unintentional omissions, duplications, overlapping area, erroneous nomenclature, faulty description of boundary lines, street closings, changes in names of streets or of public places, alteration of the courses of rivers or streams, the filling in of lands under water, or changes in shorelines due to accretion, the secretary of state is authorized and empowered to correct the omissions, overlaps, erroneous nomenclature, or other defects in the description of districts so as to accomplish the purposes and objectives of this chapter. In making these corrections, the secretary of state shall be guided by the following standards:
     </p>
     <ol type="1">
      <li id="t22c01s22-1-3ol11">
       Gaps in the description of any district shall be completed in a manner which results in a total description of the district in manner consonant with the description of adjacent districts.
      </li>

       Areas included within the descriptions of more than one district shall be allocated to the district having the lowest population.

        The house, as a component of the general assembly, possesses the legislative power of the state and, although malapportioned, is competent, that is to say, it has authority to exercise that power to the extent it is not prohibited from so doing by the constitution of this state.

       Districts.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The state is hereby divided into seventy-five (75) representative districts bounded and described as follows:
     </p>
     <ol type="1">
      <li id="t22c02s22-2-2ol11">
       It is understood and intended that for the purpose of this section a line described as running on, on, to or through any street (including road, avenue, lane, way, parkway, expressway, divided Highway, state route or interstate route, or trail), stream or river, is intended to mean the centerline of that street, stream or river, and a line described as the shoreline is intended to mean the line on the mean low water level, and a feature extension is intended to mean the imaginary straight-line extension from the end of a map feature, usually a street or road, to another feature as for example, from the end of a dead-end street to a nearby river, in all instances, unless the same shall be otherwise specified.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c02s22-2-2ol12">
       It is further understood and intended that for the purpose of this section, the districts described in this section shall be composed of United States census geography (tracts and blocks), as defined by the 2020 version of the “TIGER” files from the United States Census Bureau, whose boundaries correspond to the below metes and bounds set forth in this section and hereby made a part of this chapter. A listing of which census blocks are contained within each district shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c02s22-2-2ol13">
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t22c02s22-2-2ol13i">
         It is further understood and intended that for the purpose of this section, the districts will be depicted on thirty-nine (39) maps known as House Plan D — Substitute A, compiled by Election Data Services, Inc. for each city and town, and hereinafter may be referred to as town maps.
        </li>
        <li id="t22c02s22-2-2ol13ii">
         The secretary of state shall keep a copy of each set of the foregoing maps and a copy of the census tract and block listing available for inspection during ordinary business hours at his or her office. The secretary of state shall furnish each city and town a copy of the town map covering that particular city or town within ten (10) days from the date of passage of this act.
        </li>
        <li id="t22c02s22-2-2ol13iii">
         For purposes of this title, references to “tract” or “CT” shall mean “census tract,” as that demographic unit is established by the United States Bureau of the census for the 2020 census as described by maps and publications of the bureau. References to “block,” “blocks,” or “block groups,” refer to those demographic units as established by the United States Census Bureau for the 2020 census as described by maps and publications of the bureau.
        </li>
        <li id="t22c02s22-2-2ol13iv">
         Any reference to a “city or town,” “city or town boundaries,” or “city or town limits” shall refer to the boundaries or limits of the particular city or town as defined by the 2020 version of the “TIGER” files from the United States Census Bureau.
        </li>
        <li id="t22c02s22-2-2ol13v">
         In the census tract and block listing, the first two (2) digits of a census description shall refer to the State of Rhode Island (44), the next three (3) digits of a census description shall refer to the county in which the district lies. Bristol county carries the code 001; Kent county carries the code 003; Newport county carries the code 005; Providence county carries the code 007 and Washington county carries the code 009. The next six (6) digits refer to the census tract within the county set forth in the description. The last four (4) digits refer to the census block within the census tract. “TIGER” is an acronym for the computer readable geographic data base that automates the mapping and related geographic activities required to support the United States’ Census Bureau’s census and survey programs and stands for “Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing.”
        </li>
        <li id="t22c02s22-2-2ol13vi">
         If any census tract, block, block group, or enumeration district is omitted, listed more than once, or is only partially provided for, it is intended that the districts be defined in such a manner as to not omit any area of Rhode Island from a district and to comply with the standard of Articles VII and VIII of the Rhode Island Constitution requiring that districts be reasonably equal. In order to carry out the intent of the general assembly as expressed in this section the secretary of state, shall if necessary, undertake measures to insure compliance with this section.
        </li>
        <li id="t22c02s22-2-2ol13vii">
         In the event of a discrepancy between the metes and bounds description, the description by census tracts and blocks, and the maps which shall be on file with the secretary of state, then the listing of census tracts and blocks shall take precedence and be controlling

It is also intended that no representative district shall include any of the area included within the description of any other representative district. If the districts described in this chapter do not carry out the purposes of them because of patent unintentional omissions, duplications, overlapping areas, erroneous nomenclature, faulty description of boundary lines, street closings, changes in names of streets or of public places, alteration of the courses of rivers or streams, the filling in of lands under water, or changes in shorelines due to accretion, the secretary of state is authorized and empowered to correct the omissions, overlaps, erroneous nomenclature, or other defects in the description of districts so as to accomplish the purposes and objectives of this chapter. In making these corrections, the secretary of state shall be guided by the following standards:

       This section was amended by two acts (P.L. 2002, ch. 4, § 21; P.L. 2002, ch. 371, § 1) passed by the 2002 General Assembly. Since the changes made by both acts are not in conflict with each other, the section is set out as amended by both acts.

      <p>
       P.L. 2002, ch. 4, § 13, provides: “This act shall take effect upon its passage [February 20, 2002]; provided, however, that the provisions hereof shall first be effective in connection with elections to be held on or subsequent to the first day of September, 2002, and for the purpose of greater clarity, the first election under the provisions of this act for congress, senator and representative from each of the senatorial, congressional or representative districts hereby created, shall be held on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November, 2002, and the first primary election under the provisions of this act for nomination of candidates for congress, senator and for representative from each of said representative district shall be held on the second Tuesday after the first Monday in September, 2002, provided, however, that if any provision of this act or the application of such provision to any person or under any circumstances shall be held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid or inoperative by a decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, or if any action performed or to be performed under any provision of this act is restrained or enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this act shall not be deemed to be impaired or affected thereby but shall be deemed to remain in full force and effect.

All subpoenas and orders shall be served as subpoenas in civil cases in the superior court are now served, and witnesses so subpoenaed shall be entitled to the same fees for attendance and travel as now provided for witnesses in civil cases in the superior court. If the person subpoenaed to attend before the committee fails to obey the command of the subpoena without reasonable cause, or refuses to be sworn, or to be examined, or to answer a legal and pertinent question, or if any person shall refuse to produce books, accounts, papers, records, and documents material to the issue, set forth in an order duly served on that person, the committee by majority vote of the committee members present may apply to any justice of the superior court, for any county, upon proof by affidavit of the fact, for a rule or order returnable in not less than two (2) nor more than five (5) days, directing the person to show cause before the justice who made the order or any other justice described above why he or she should not be adjudged in contempt. Upon the return of the orders the justice before whom the matter is brought on for hearing shall examine under oath that person, and the person shall be given an opportunity to be heard, and if the justice shall determine that the person has refused without reasonable cause or legal excuse to be examined or to answer a legal and pertinent question, or to produce books, accounts, papers, records, and documents material to the issue which he or she was ordered to bring or produce, the justice may immediately commit the offender to the adult correctional institutions, there to remain until he or she submits to do the act which he or she was required to do, or is discharged according to law.

        Insofar as the speaker of the House in Rhode Island and the head doorkeeper enforced House Rule 45, which controls admission to the floor, against private lobbyists but spared governmental lobbyists from exclusion, those individuals acted within the legislative sphere and are protected from judicial interference by the doctrine of absolute legislative immunity.

       The general assembly recognizes that the security of government computer systems is essential to ensuring the stability and integrity of vital information gathered and stored by government for the benefit of the citizenry and the breach of security over computer systems presents a risk to the health, safety, and welfare of the public. It is the intent of the legislature to insure that government computer systems and information residing on these systems are protected from unauthorized access, compromise, sabotage, hacking, viruses, destruction, illegal use, cyber attack or any other act which might jeopardize or harm the computer systems and the information stored on them.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c13s22-13-10ol1b">
       In conjunction with the powers and duties outlined in this chapter, the auditor general may conduct reviews and assessments of the various government computer systems and the security systems established to safeguard these computer systems. Computer systems subject to this section shall include systems which pertain to federal, state, or local programs, and quasi-governmental bodies, and the computer systems of any entity or program which is subject to audit by the office of the auditor general. The auditor general’s review may include an assessment of system vulnerability, network penetration, potential security breaches, and susceptibility to cyber attack and cyber fraud.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c13s22-13-10ol1c">
       In the event the review by the auditor general indicates a computer system is vulnerable, or security over the system is lacking, those findings shall not be disclosed publicly and shall not be considered public records. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the workpapers developed in connection with the review of the computer system and the security over the system shall not be deemed public records and are not subject to disclosure. The auditor general’s findings may be disclosed at the discretion of the auditor general to the chief information officer of the state as well as the joint committee on legislative services. Unless the auditor general authorizes the release of information or findings gathered in the conduct of a review of computer system security, all such information shall be deemed classified, confidential, secret, and non-public.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c13s22-13-10ol1d">
       In order to maintain the integrity of the computer system, the auditor general may procure the services of specialists in information security systems or other contractors deemed necessary in conducting reviews under this section, and in procuring those services shall be exempt from the requirements of the state purchasing law or regulation.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c13s22-13-10ol1e">
       Any outside contractor or vendor hired to provide services in the review of the security of a computer system shall be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this section.
