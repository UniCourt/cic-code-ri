    </h2>
    <p>
     We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

    <p>
     On February 21, 1787, Congress adopted a resolution in favor of a convention to devise provisions to render the Constitution of the federal government adequate to the exigencies of the union. Subsequently all of the original states except Rhode Island appointed delegates to the convention. The convention convened on May 25, 1787, and completed the proposed Constitution on September 17, 1787. On September 28, 1787, Congress ordered the Constitution submitted to conventions of the people of the various states.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rhode Island ratified the Constitution on May 29, 1790, and the President so notified Congress on June 1, 1790. The dates of ratification by the others of the original thirteen states were as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
     Connecticut, January 9, 1788; Delaware, December 7, 1787; Georgia, January 2, 1788; Maryland, April 28, 1788; Massachusetts, February 6, 1788; New Hampshire, June 21, 1788; New Jersey, December 18, 1787; New York, July 26, 1788; North Carolina, November 21, 1789; Pennsylvania, December 12, 1787; South Carolina, May 23, 1788; Virginia, June 26, 1788.

        The authority to make administrative rules is not a delegation of legislative power, and those rules are not raised from an administrative to a legislative character because the violation thereof is punished as a public offense. United States v. Grimaud, 220 U.S. 506, 31 S. Ct. 480, 55 L. Ed. 563, 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1695 (1911).

        The act continuing state regulation and taxation of the insurance business ( 15 U.S.C. §§ 1011,
        1012) is not an unconstitutional delegation by congress of its powers to the states.
        Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U.S. 408, 66 S. Ct. 1142, 90 L. Ed. 1342, 1946 U.S. LEXIS 3068 (1946).

        The Constitution does not require that congress find for itself every fact upon which it desires to base legislative action or that it make for itself detailed determinations which it has declared to be prerequisite to the application of the legislative policy to particular facts and circumstances which are impossible for congress itself properly to investigate.

      Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons. The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct. The number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand, but each state shall have at least one representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the state of New Hampshire shall be entitled to choose three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three.

      The senate of the United States shall be composed of two senators from each state, chosen by the legislature thereof, for six years; and each senator shall have one vote.
     </p>
     <p>
      Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes. The seats of the senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year, of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year, and of the third class at the expiration of the sixth year, so that one-third may be chosen every second year; and if vacancies happen by resignation, or otherwise, during the recess of the legislature of any state, the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature, which shall then fill such vacancies.
     </p>
     <p>
      No person shall be a senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years, and been nine years a citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The vice-president of the United States shall be president of the senate, but shall have no vote, unless they be equally divided.
     </p>
     <p>
      The senate shall choose their other officers, and also a president pro tempore, in the absence of the vice-president, or when he shall exercise the office of president of the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      The senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation. When the president of the United States is tried, the chief justice shall preside; and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present.
     </p>
     <p>
      Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States; but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law.

     <p>
      Every bill which shall have passed the house of representatives and the senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the president of the United States; if he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his objections to that house in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration two-thirds of that house shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered; and if approved by two-thirds of that house, it shall become a law. But in all such cases the votes of both houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each house respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the president within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a law; in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case it shall not be a law.

      Every order, resolution, or vote, to which the concurrence of the senate and house of representatives may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the president of the United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of the senate and house of representatives, according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill.

        The government cannot after a patent is issued make use of the improvement any more than a private individual without license of the inventor or making compensation to him. United States v. Burns, 79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 246, 20 L. Ed. 388, 7 Ct. Cl. 219, 1870 U.S. LEXIS 1186 (1871).

        Legislation based on the provision relating to patents regards the right of property in the inventor as the medium of the public advantage derived from his invention, hence in every grant of the limited monopoly two interests are involved: (1) that of the public who are the grantors, and (2) that of the patentee. Butterworth v. United States ex rel. Hoe, 112 U.S. 50, 5 S. Ct. 25, 28 L. Ed. 656, 1884 U.S. LEXIS 1852 (1884).

        State pilotage law is not repugnant to the port preference clause where it neither gives a preference of one port over another, nor requires a vessel to pay duties. Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 53 U.S. (12 How.) 299, 13 L. Ed. 996, 12 How. 299, 1851 U.S. LEXIS 658 (1852).
       </p>
       <p>
        The port preference clause operates only as a limitation of the powers of congress, and in no respect affects the states in the regulation of their domestic affairs. Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 113, 24 L. Ed. 77, 1876 U.S. LEXIS 1842 (1877).

        The word “state” in the port preference clause does not include territory. Alaska v. Troy, 258 U.S. 101, 42 S. Ct. 241, 66 L. Ed. 487, 5 Alaska Fed. 104, 1922 U.S. LEXIS 2245 (1922).

        Congress may levy a tax on net income derived from the business of exporting merchandise in foreign commerce, though not upon articles exported. William E. Peck &amp; Co. v. Lowe, 247 U.S. 165, 38 S. Ct. 432, 62 L. Ed. 1049, 1918 U.S. LEXIS 1966 (1918); New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, 300 U.S. 308, 57 S. Ct. 466, 81 L. Ed. 666, 1937 U.S. LEXIS 74 (1937).

         Bill of Attainder.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A bill of attainder is a legislative act which inflicts punishment without a judicial trial. Cummings v. Missouri, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277, 18 L. Ed. 356, 1866 U.S. LEXIS 885 (1867).
       </p>
       <p>
        A city or town cannot by ordinance or charter bar relatives of an elected municipal official from being appointed to municipal offices or being employed by the municipality, since same would constitute a bill of attainder. Opinion to House of Representatives,
        <cite class="ri_code">

       </p>
       <p>
        If a legislative act impermissibly designates an individual or an easily identifiable group and then proceeds to punish that person or group, the act is a bill of attainder. United Nuclear Corp. v. Cannon, 553 F. Supp. 1220, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9943 (D.R.I. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        P.L. 1981, ch. 85, requiring the only nuclear fuel processing plant in the state to post a bond for 20 years to ensure adequate decontamination efforts and results, represents a permissible legislative initiative aimed at safeguarding a distinct and substantial public interest although limited to a class of one, and therefore is not invalid as a bill of attainder. United Nuclear Corp. v. Cannon, 553 F. Supp. 1220, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9943 (D.R.I. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether a statute inflicts punishment and qualifies as a Bill of Attainder, three factors are relevant: (1) whether the challenged statute falls within the historical meaning of legislative punishment; (2) whether the statute viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed reasonably can be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes; and (3) whether the legislative record evidences a legislative intent to punish. Section
        <cite class="ocri">

        </cite>
        does not rise to a Bill of Attainder because: (1) it does not limit a defendant’s access to the courts or right to contribution, it merely limits the right of the settling tortfeasor’s contribution; (2) it promotes settlements and decreases the litigation expenses incurred by taxpayers; and (3) the legislative history does not indicate that passage of the section was motivated solely to punish one party. Ernst &amp; Young v. Depositors Economic Protection Corp., 862 F. Supp. 709, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12822 (D.R.I. 1994), aff'd, 45 F.3d 530, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 1387 (1st Cir. 1995).

        Notes issued by a bank which was created by the legislature and which was the exclusive property of the state were not bills of credit. Briscoe v.

        At common law if the victim did not die within a year and a day, a murder could not have been committed, so retroactive application of the abrogation of the year-and-a-day rule, would “aggravate” the crime of assault and battery, making it greater than it was when committed or greater than it could have been before the expiration of a year and a day; although the ex post facto prohibition applies to legislation only, the due-process clause prevents the accomplishment by judicial construction of that which is not permitted by statute, and the abrogation will not be applied retroactively.

      The executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America. He shall hold his office during the term of four years, and, together with the vice-president, chosen for the same term, be elected as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress; but no senator or representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector.
     </p>
     <p>
      The electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves. And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which list they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the president of the senate. The president of the senate shall, in the presence of the senate and house of representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the president, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the house of representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for president; and if no person have a majority, then from the five highest on the list the said house shall in like manner choose the president. But in choosing the president, the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice. In every case, after the choice of the president, the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the vice-president. But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes, the senate shall choose from them by ballot the vice-president.
     </p>
     <p>
      The congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall be the same throughout the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      No person except a natural-born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of president; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      In case of the removal of the president from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the vice-president, and the congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or inability, both of the president and vice-president, declaring what officer shall then act as president, and such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a president shall be elected.
     </p>
     <p>
      The president shall, at stated times, receive for his services, a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected; and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States, or any of them.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before he enters on the execution of his office, he shall take the following oath or affirmation:
     </p>
     <p>
      “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”

        Congress may determine whether the federal courts which it has established should have exclusive jurisdiction of cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States or whether they should exercise that jurisdiction concurrently with the courts of the state. Bowles v. Willingham, 321 U.S. 503, 64 S. Ct. 641, 88 L. Ed. 892, 28 Ohio Op. 180, 1944 U.S. LEXIS 1202 (1944).

        The United States supreme court should not undertake to decide questions of local law without the aid of some expression of the views of the judges of the local courts who are familiar with the intricacies and trends of local law and practice. Busby v. Electric Utilities Employees Union, 323 U.S. 72, 65 S. Ct. 142, 89 L. Ed. 78, 1944 U.S. LEXIS 1250 (1944).

        The supreme law clause (Article 6) was not intended to be the means by which congress could compel a state to provide at its own expense, courts for the enforcement of federal laws which those states deemed to be penal, and therefore unenforceable in its courts.

      The judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; — to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; — to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; — to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; — to controversies between two or more states; — between a state and citizens of another state; — between citizens of different states; — between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.

     <p>
      In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned, the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the congress shall make.
     </p>
     <p>
      The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the congress may by law have directed.

        This section requires that state courts recognize judgments of the courts of sister states, provided the sister state’s court properly exercise subject-matter and personal jurisdiction. Jordan v. Jordan, 586 A.2d 1080,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1991 R.I. LEXIS 25

       <p>
        A judgment of a court of a state has credit, validity, and effect in all courts within the United States. Hampton v. M'Connel, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 234, 4 L. Ed. 378, 1818 U.S. LEXIS 361 (1818).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judgments of other states do not enjoy the right of priority, or privilege, or lien, which they have in the state where they are pronounced, but that only which the lex fori gives to them by its own laws in their character of foreign judgments. Cole v. Cunningham, 133 U.S. 107, 10 S. Ct. 269, 33 L. Ed. 538, 1890 U.S. LEXIS 1895 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        This provision does not extend the jurisdiction of the courts of one state to property situated in another, but only makes the judgment rendered conclusive on the merits of the claim or subject matter of the suit. Fall v. Eastin, 215 U.S. 1, 30 S. Ct. 3, 54 L. Ed. 65, 1909 U.S. LEXIS 1726 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision in G.L. 1896, ch. 155, § 4 [former § 5-31-2] requiring persons wishing to practice dentistry in Rhode Island to take an examination for the purpose of securing certificate to practice does not violate the due faith and credit clause of federal Constitution, since there is no provision in the act which requires state board to ignore certificates to practice dentistry issued by other states.

        Where a decree from another state is not shown to be final and conclusive, but subject to modification, the decree is not entitled to the protection of the full faith and credit clause. Hewett v. Hewett,

        In view of the fact that the United States supreme court has not finally decided how far it will go in holding legislative acts to be “public acts” within the meaning of the good faith and credit clause, the Rhode Island supreme court refused to enforce wrongful death act of Massachusetts, since it was a penal statute. McGrath v. Tobin,

        Judgment taken in New York and sued on in Rhode Island was entitled to full faith and credit where defendant failed to show that judgment could be successfully attacked in New York due to alleged fraud of plaintiff in obtaining judgment. Jaron v. Frank, 227 F.2d 277, 1955 U.S. App. LEXIS 3188 (1st Cir. 1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        The full faith and credit clause does not bar Rhode Island from giving effect to a Massachusetts statute by comity, or from adopting a Massachusetts decree as its own, provided there is no contrary statute or public policy in Rhode Island against it. Skeadas v. Sklaroff,

        Where New York court had jurisdiction to hear cy pres proceeding because trustee and trust fund were located in New York, although the trust fund had been applied to a Rhode Island beneficiary and the Rhode Island attorney general was not notified of or made a party to the proceedings, the New York decision was entitled to full faith and credit.

        Where the judgment of a foreign court is based on valid in rem jurisdiction over the subject matter and on in personam jurisdiction over the parties, this state must enforce that judgment to the extent that it is final and nonmodifiable. Bouchard v. Bouchard,

        Although the full faith and credit clause commands Rhode Island courts to give the judgment of a sister state full cordit, it does not confer upon that judgment a constitutional claim to a more conclusive effect in the Rhode Island courts than it would have in the courts of the state where rendered.

        A judgment for a fixed sum for alimony due is entitled to full faith and credit in another state, but a provision for payment of alimony in the future which is subject to the discretion of the court in the state where rendered is not a final judgment for a fixed sum. Lynde v. Lynde, 181 U.S. 183, 21 S. Ct. 555, 45 L. Ed. 810, 1901 U.S. LEXIS 1356 (1901).

        An award of full alimony agreed upon by the parties in a decree of divorce in Arkansas was a bar to an award of further alimony in a suit by the divorced wife in another state in which the husband owned real property.

       <p>
        Refusal of state supreme court to give credit to judgment of a sister state for alimony because subject to modification is a ruling upon a federal right, and the sufficiency of the grounds for denial is for the United States supreme court to decide, and while the United States supreme court will give deference to the opinion of the court of the forum in determining the applicable law of the state which rendered the judgment sought to be enforced, the view of such latter court is not conclusive.

        The right to “demand” implies an absolute right and there is a correlative obligation to deliver without reference to character of crime charged. Kentucky v.

        A person, who was not within the state at the time stated in the indictment, or at any time when the acts were committed, was not a fugitive from justice, and his subsequent presence for one day in the state, eight days after commission of alleged offense, did not render him a fugitive from justice when he left the state. Hyatt v. People ex rel. Corkran, 188 U.S. 691, 23 S. Ct. 456, 47 L. Ed. 657, 1903 U.S. LEXIS 1313 (1903).

        A person charged by indictment or affidavit before a magistrate with the commission of a crime within the state, who after the date of the commission of such crime leaves the state, no matter for what purpose or with what motive, or under what belief, is from the time of such leaving a fugitive from justice. Appleyard v. Massachusetts, 203 U.S. 222, 27 S. Ct. 122, 51 L. Ed. 161, 1906 U.S. LEXIS 1584 (1906).

        A criminal need not do within the state the overt act necessary to complete the crime, and if he does there an overt act which is and is intended to be a material step toward accomplishment of the crime, and then absents himself from the state and does the rest elsewhere, he is a fugitive from justice. Strassheim v. Daily, 221 U.S. 280, 31 S. Ct. 558, 55 L. Ed. 735, 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1733 (1911).

        Habeas corpus to secure release of one held for extradition is not a criminal proceeding, and the governor’s warrant is prima facie evidence of rightful custody, and the court should not discharge the prisoner except on the showing of clear and satisfactory evidence that the alleged fugitive is not properly held. South Carolina v. Bailey, 289 U.S. 412, 53 S. Ct. 667, 77 L. Ed. 1292, 1933 U.S. LEXIS 187 (1933).

        The issuing of a warrant by the governor with or without a recital therein that the person demanded is a fugitive from justice is sufficient, and such person has no constitutional right to be heard on the question as to whether he had been substantially charged with a crime.

        Statutes which distinguish between rights of residents and nonresidents of the state may be valid so long as the statutes do not infringe upon rights incident to citizenship, so that a Virginia statute which prohibited nonresidents from catching fish in the waters of the state for the manufacture of oil was not in violation of this section.

        The sole purpose of the privileges and immunities provision is to declare to the several states that whatever those rights, which you grant or establish for your own citizens, or which you limit or qualify or impose restrictions on their exercise, the same, neither more nor less, is the measure of the rights of citizens of the other states within your jurisdiction.

     Even without an express provision for preemption, state law must yield to a congressional statute where Congress intends that federal law should occupy the field and where state law is naturally preempted to the extent of any conflict with a federal statute. Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 120 S. Ct. 2288, 147 L. Ed. 2d 352, 2000 U.S. LEXIS 4153 (2000).

     The state is free to enact limitations on the type and amount of service for which members of the retirement system can purchase retirement credit, but federal law will preempt any state law that differentiates between those who receive a military pension and those who do not when offering former military personnel the opportunity to purchase retirement credit.

      — Conflict Between Federal Statutes.

    </h5>
    <p>
     The doctrine of preemption applies only to conflicts between federal provisions, on the one hand, and state or local provisions, on the other hand, and the proper mode of analysis for cases that involve a perceived conflict between two federal statutes is that of implied repeal. Rhode Island v. Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d 685, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 5487 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 919, 115 S. Ct. 298, 130 L. Ed. 2d 211, 1994 U.S. LEXIS 6990 (1994).

     Among the matters which are implied, though not expressed in the Constitution, is that the nation may not in the exercise of its powers prevent a state from discharging the ordinary functions of government, just as it follows from the clause that no state can interfere with the free and unembarrassed exercise by the national government of all the powers conferred upon it. South Carolina v. United States, 199 U.S. 437, 26 S. Ct. 110, 50 L. Ed. 261, 41 Ct. Cl. 503, 1905 U.S. LEXIS 991 (1905).

     of federal funds from the determination of local school district expenditures did not violate the supremacy clause; for although the federal program was intended to supplement and not substitute for state aid to local districts, the intent and effect of the exclusion was not to reduce state aid in proportion to federal funding, but only to assess the amount of local funding free of distortion by outside grants.

     The state’s authority to regulate interstate wholesale utility rates was preempted by congress’ enactment of the Federal Power Act, hence jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of the wholesale rate charged by the New England Power Company to the Narragansett Electric Company rests exclusively with the federal power commission.

     P.L. 1981, ch. 85, requiring the state’s only nuclear fuel processing plant to post a bond for 20 years to ensure adequate decontamination efforts and results, represented a simultaneous attempt at regulation in an area preempted by federal law and is therefore invalid under the supremacy clause of this article.

     While a treaty and an act of congress are placed on the same footing by the Constitution when they both relate to the same subject, and courts will construe them so as to give effect to both, if the two are inconsistent, the one last in date will control, providing the stipulations of the treaty are self-executing.

        In addition to the general rule that the judiciary ought not to interfere with the internal affairs of political parties and the belief that a large public interest is served in allowing the political processes to function free from judicial supervision, to some extent, the autonomy of political parties and other private groups is constitutionally protected by this amendment, and political parties are therefore generally recognized to have certain “inherent powers of self-government” and to be vested with wide discretion to interpret and decide their own regulations, rules, and disputes.

        The First Amendment does not divest secular courts of jurisdiction over claims against officials of hierarchical churches where liability is predicated upon the officials’ alleged failure to take appropriate action to prevent sexual assaults by clergy subject to their authority.

        The Supreme Court has developed a three-part test to determine whether particular statutes violate the establishment clause; first, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.

        When limited closure is ordered, the constitutional values sought to be protected by holding open proceedings may be satisfied later by making a transcript of the closed proceedings available within a reasonable time, if the judge determines that disclosure can be accomplished while safeguarding the juror’s valid privacy interests. Even then a valid privacy right may rise to a level that part of the transcript should be sealed, or the name of a juror withheld, to protect the person from embarrassment. Providence Journal Co. v.

        A newspaper’s qualified right of access to an FBI agent’s affidavit that was submitted in support of a request for a warrant to search the Providence City Hall was outweighed by the likelihood that dissemination of the affidavit’s contents prior to trial would prejudice the defendants’ right to a fair trial where (1) the affidavit was unusually prejudicial as it contained many statements that appeared to have little bearing on whether probable cause existed to search the locations in question, (2) it contained more statements attributed to third parties and anonymous sources than are found in a typical search warrant affidavit, as well as an inordinate number of what were nothing more than the affiant’s conclusions and opinions, (3) it was written in a uniquely inflammatory style, with a storybook format that was liberally interspersed with evocative headings and characterizations, and (4) it contained derogatory statements about individuals who had not been charged that were unsubstantiated.

        Although high policy-making employees from whom the need for personal loyalty and confidence is great may permissibly be terminated for making statements which are otherwise protected by the first amendment, the manager of a decentralized unit of the institute of mental health was not such an employee, since he was charged only with implementing internally and externally imposed hospital policies, and did not enjoy a close working relationship with his superiors such that extraordinary intimacy or confidentiality were required; thus the manager’s criticisms of his superiors were protected under the first amendment. Pilkington v. Bevilacqua, 439 F. Supp. 465, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13698 (D.R.I. 1977), aff'd, 590 F.2d 386, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 17586 (1st Cir. 1979).

        Where the manager of an institute of mental health unit showed that his criticisms of his superiors were a motivating factor in his discharge, and the evidence did not sufficiently support the charge of incompetence that defendant cited as the reason for the manager’s dismissal, the court held that the defendant would not have dismissed the manager in the absence of his protected criticisms, and ordered his reinstatement. Pilkington v. Bevilacqua, 439 F. Supp. 465, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13698 (D.R.I. 1977), aff'd, 590 F.2d 386, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 17586 (1st Cir. 1979).

        It is certainly clear that outside of the classroom the fear — however justified — of a violent reaction is not sufficient reason to restrain speech in advance, and an actual hostile reaction is rarely an adequate basis for curtailing free speech.

        While communicative intent may not always transform conduct into speech, Gay Students Organization v.

        Fire marshal’s investigator who also drew a fire department disability pension failed to show actionable defamation or appropriation of his likeness by a broadcaster whose investigative reporter questioned the propriety (legality of the practice was not in question) of what might have been perceived as double dipping, and summary judgment was properly entered in the broadcaster’s favor, since there was nothing defamatory about exercising the right of fair comment regarding true facts; rebroadcast of an excerpt from the original broadcast for promotional purposes was not an actionable invasion of privacy because the original broadcast had not been defamatory, and a voice over comment suggesting the investigator and others might be doing something wrong was insufficient to change that earlier characterization as not defamatory.

        The present state of the law imposes two major bodies of restrictions in respect to allowing recovery for defamatory publications: First, in regard to public officials and public figures, no recovery may be permitted unless the plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence that the publication was made with knowledge that the defamatory statement was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not; and second, in regard to private citizens, the states may apply their own laws in respect to the publishing of defamatory material, except that liability may not be established without fault and in the event that exemplary damages are to be awarded, then the “actual malice” element must be shown by clear and convincing evidence.

        When a government employee directs speech towards a government employer, the employee’s first amendment rights must be balanced against the interest of the state, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.

        When speech is public, the content of a teacher’s statements must be assessed to determine whether they impede the proper performance of classroom duties or interfere with the regular operation of the schools. Smith v. Harris, 560 F. Supp. 677, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18104 (D.R.I. 1983).

        Plaintiff prospective teacher failed to show that her constitutionally protected conduct, including her participation in partisan political activities and in community and school committee affairs, was a “motivating” or “substantial” factor in a school district’s failure to hire her and thus failed to establish a cognizable claim. Smith v. Harris, 560 F. Supp. 677, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18104 (D.R.I. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the simple fact of a teacher’s termination eight months after a public controversy over a reading program in which the teacher publicly criticized a reduction in the program was not enough to show a violation of her constitutional right of free speech, the jury could have concluded that the superintendent and principal of the school retaliated against the teacher for her exercise of first amendment rights by ordering a termination they were without power to order, unjustifiably threatening another firing shortly after the school district reinstated the teacher, and then depriving her of a job to which she was entitled, and that such outrageous conduct supported a punitive damage award. Fishman v. Clancy, 763 F.2d 485, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 19803 (1st Cir. 1985).
       </p>

        The employment of a public employee was not terminated in retaliation for the exercise of his right to free speech, i.e., furnishing a city councilman with information which documented the councilman’s criticisms of the city administration, but as a part of the ongoing reorganization of city operations so as to eliminate unnecessary positions, which was constitutionally permitted. See Joslyn v. Kinch, 613 F. Supp. 1168, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17540 (D.R.I. 1985).
       </p>

       <p>
        The confidentiality provisions of the Rhode Island Code of Ethics impose unconstitutional restraints on the free speech rights of a citizen who files an ethics complaint against a mayor and members of a city council; public discussion of the existence and substance of an ethics complaint formally filed under oath against a public official is speech protected by the first amendment.

        The city’s refusal to reappoint plaintiff or to continue her employment as a police matron for political reasons after she had failed to support the former mayor in an election for the office of city council constituted a violation of her first amendment rights.

       </p>
       <p>
        Fire department rules requiring prior permission for public speech posed imminent injury in that the fire chief’s broad discretion to censor constitutionally-protected speech threatened the plaintiffs’ rights even if they had never asked the chief for permission, and in that the need for plaintiffs to apply through channels before any speech created an inherent delay, since even a temporary restraint on expression may constitute irreparable injury. Providence Firefighters Local 799 v. City of Providence, 26 F. Supp. 2d 350, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17185 (D.R.I. 1998).

       <p>
        Restrictions on fire department employee speech curbed a substantial interest held both by plaintiffs and the public where the matters upon which the plaintiffs’ wished to speak to citizens included fire department policies, tax money and fire safety in public buildings and schools.

       </p>
       <p>
        The suppression of plaintiffs’ free speech rights, and the harm resulting to the public from fire department rules requiring prior permission to speak to citizens on issues of public concern, far outweighed any speculative harm to the government through leakage to the media about investigations.

        Because the Open Meetings Law is premised on the first amendment values of an informed public and the accountability of public institutions, certain constitutional principles should apply to the regulation of the right to tape record open, public meetings. If officials were to grant or deny permission to record on the basis of content, they would undermine the nations’s commitment to the equality of status in the field of ideas. Also, under the equal protection clause, as well as under the First Amendment, unbridled discretion cannot be ceded to government officials to decide whether leave to record public meetings will be granted.

        The rigorousness of a court’s inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the extent to which a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. When the right to vote is subjected to severe restrictions, the regulation must be narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance; when the state law imposes only reasonable restrictions upon the rights of voters, the state’s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify the restrictions.

        When the Board of Elections declared a primary election for school committee invalid and scheduled a new election restricted to the voters who had participated in the first election, the Board of Elections violated First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of those eligible voters who wished to vote in the second election but had not voted in the first election. Ayers-Schaffner v. DiStefano, 860 F. Supp. 918, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12010 (D.R.I.), aff'd, 37 F.3d 726, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 27891 (1st Cir. 1994).

        When deciding whether a state election law violates associational rights under the federal Constitution, the court weighs the character and magnitude of the burden the state’s rule imposes on those rights against the interests the state contends justify that burden, and considers the extent to which the state’s concerns make the burden necessary. Cool Moose Party v. Rhode Island, 183 F.3d 80, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 20800 (1st Cir. 1999).

        on the ability of a party to invite registered voters from other parties to participate in its primary, the court affirmed the district court’s ruling that prohibiting such voters was unconstitutional to the extent that it prohibited them from voting in the primary of another party whose bylaws would permit their participation.

        A person is seized or under arrest for Fourth Amendment purposes if, in view of all the circumstances, a reasonable person would believe that he or she was not free to leave. In making this determination, a court may consider the following factors: (1) the extent to which the person’s freedom is curtailed; (2) the degree of force employed by the police; (3) the belief of a reasonable, innocent person in identical circumstances; and (4) whether the person had the option of not accompanying the police.

        It was not error to deny defendant’s motion to suppress defendant’s inculpatory statements to a police officer because defendant was not in custody when defendant made the statements, as nothing showed defendant’s freedom of movement was curtailed or that the officer used force that would make a reasonable person think the person was not free to leave.

        Where an informant told police that defendant admitted killing the victim, and told them a detail about the murder that had not been released publicly, her information about him, coupled with his own statements and actions, furnished probable cause to arrest him without a warrant; therefore, his confession and evidence seized by police were admissible.

        The Fourth Amendment does not require that an officer have a reasonable belief or a valid reason to suspect that a person is armed and dangerous before he or she can order the person out of a lawfully stopped vehicle.

        A particularized suspicion was justifiably raised in the minds of the arresting officers that the defendant was engaged in or was about to engage in wrongdoing since the defendant, a passenger in a speeding vehicle in which the driver was unable to produce either a driver’s license or the vehicle’s registration, was fidgeting, looking away, and when after exiting the vehicle, the defendant shied away from the officer on one side. Although furtive gestures alone are not sufficient to justify a

        Whether the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures has been violated depends on whether the person asserting a fourth amendment violation had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched or the thing seized.

        The Supreme Court has set forth a two-step test for determining whether a reasonable expectation of privacy exists: whether the individual has exhibited a subjective expectation and whether such subjective expectation, viewed objectively, is justifiable under the circumstances. The burden is on the defendant to satify these two tests. United States v. Thornley, 707 F.2d 622, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 28069 (1st Cir. 1983).

        Whatever application the theory of waiver may have within the confines of the criminal proceeding, including, of course, appellate and habeas review, the effect that a litigant’s conduct has in a subsequent and distinct litigation is governed by the twin doctrines of claim and issue preclusion, and where defendant did not litigate the validity of the search and seizure at his criminal trial, he is not foreclosed from raising that issue in a later civil forfeiture proceeding.

        As defendant had agreed to a stipulation of facts upon which his weapon convictions were based after his suppression motion as to a pistol and his confession was denied by the trial court, defendant’s arguments on appeal regarding the alleged violation of his rights under U.S. Const. amend.

        Where murder defendant had issued both an express and a clearly implied invitation to the police to examine the entire house to determine whether a burglary had been an attendant circumstance of her husband’s death, the fact that the police later determined that the “burglary” had been staged did not vitiate the invitation or the motivation of defendant for extending such an invitation.

        The court did not err in holding that the consent of the defendant’s wife to search a vehicle registered in her name was given freely and voluntarily where the evidence in the record showed that she freely signed the consent form without any force, coercion, or promises by the police and she admitted in testimony that no one forced her to make a statement or to sign the consent forms. Her testimony that she signed the forms because she was frightened that the police would detain her further did not invalidate her consent given that she conceded that the police informed her that nothing would happen to her so long as she told the truth.

        In the context of both the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, evidence derived from sources separate from a constitutional violation need not be suppressed under the exclusionary rule. The question as to whether the inevitable discovery exception is available arises after there has been a determination that an accused’s constitutional rights have been violated; when the evidence sought to be suppressed would inevitably have been discovered without reference to the police error or misconduct, there is no nexus sufficient to provide a taint and the evidence is admissible.

        The exclusionary rule mandates that statements obtained by exploitation of an illegal arrest are fruits of the poisonous tree and are to be excluded at trial. State v. Burns, 431 A.2d 1199,

        The giving of Miranda warnings alone to an accused does not per se make the act sufficiently a product of free will to break, for fourth amendment purposes, the causal connection between any illegality and the confession. State v. Burns, 431 A.2d 1199,

        In order to determine on the facts whether or not statements made by defendent while in detention following an illegal arrest were obtained by exploitation of the illegal arrest, the Supreme Court must consider (1) the temporal proximity of the arrest and the confession, (2) the presence of intervening circumstances, and (3) particularly the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct. State v. Burns, 431 A.2d 1199,

        Where defendant’s confession was obtained while defendant was being detained as the result of an illegal arrest, the state not only had the initial burden of showing that defendant’s statements met the voluntariness standards required by the Fifth Amendment but also has the burden of demonstrating that the causal connection between the statements and the illegal arrest was broken so as to dispel the primary taint of the illegal seizure. State v. Burns, 431 A.2d 1199,

       <p>
        Where defendant made his statements some six to eight hours after he was taken into custody following his illegal arrest but was never allowed outside the interrogation area the whole time he was being detained, there was no intervening event of significance sufficient to break the connection between the illegal arrest and the statements made.

        A finding that a confession may satisfy the voluntariness standards of the Fifth Amendment does not necessarily mean that there is no Fourth Amendment violation. State v. Jennings, 461 A.2d 361,

        Where the defendant’s sudden willingness to incriminate himself was the result of his being confronted with illegally seized evidence indicating his guilt, the confession was obtained by the exploitation of the illegal search and seizure and was therefore inadmissible.

        Where the Supreme Court must conclude as a matter of fact that defendent was brought involuntarily to the police station for interrogation even though the police did not suspect him and had no probable cause to believe that he was guilty of a crime, the trial justice’s finding that his statements were involuntary for Fifth Amendment purposes was insufficient to overcome the Fourth Amendment violation.

        There were ample grounds to support the defendant’s arrest for murder at the time he was handcuffed, without reference to the vial of crack cocaine found immediately after the arrest.

        Evidence obtained as a result of a search incident to a lawful arrest is legally competent and therefore admissible to support the conviction of a defendant. In order for such evidence to be competent, however, it must be the product of a lawful arrest. If the arrest is unlawful, the evidence is inadmissible. State v. Levesque,

        Once an arrestee is under police control, the permissible scope of a search incident to an arrest narrows. State v. Robalewski, 418 A.2d 817,

       <p>
        The right of the police to search areas into which the arrestee may be expected to move, as well as the search of articles to be handed to the arrestee, is well settled when the movement or other acts are performed at the request of the arrestee. In that situation a limited search for weapons is reasonable. State v. Robalewski, 418 A.2d 817,

        Although many courts have recognized the right of the police to conduct a quick and cursory check of a residence when they have reasonable grounds to believe there are other persons present who might present a security risk, the purpose of this type of search is to check for persons, not things; and the search is justified only when it is necessary to allow the police to ascertain the presence of anyone who might threaten their safety or destroy evidence.

        A full custodial arrest for a misdemeanor gives rise to the right of the arresting officer to make a full search of the person at the police station as well as at the scene of such arrest. State v. Beaucage, 424 A.2d 642,

        As soon as the police had satisfied themselves that there were no other persons involved in the drug dealing for which defendant was arrested in the room, there was no longer a basis upon which to support any further right to search the premises or its contents without a warrant.

        Even in the case of an entry into the scene of a homicide, once the premises are secured and it is determined that no further danger exists, the exigency that gave rise to the limited right of entry has ceased to exist and the warrant requirement is reasserted.

        Where a constitutional violation is claimed resulting from a drug seizure following a patdown search for weapons after a traffic stop, the court should suppress the evidence if the officer negated the presence of an obvious weapon on the defendant’s person before he determined that the felt object was contraband, but not if he determined it was contraband before or simultaneous with negating the presence of a weapon. State v. Black, 721 A.2d 826,

        The determinative factor in examining whether a patdown search resulting in the seizure of contraband was constitutional should not be the subjective beliefs or hunches of the police officer involved, but whether and to what degree a reasonable officer under the circumstances would find it necessary to continue the patdown search to negate the presence of an obvious weapon.

        A trooper possessed sufficient reasonable suspicion about the defendant’s action to subject him to a weapons patdown search where the defendant made furtive and frantic movements towards his groin, continuously looked back at the trooper, and had an unusually high degree of overall nervousness.

        Where the trial court refused to accept as credible a police officer’s testimony that he believed the two inch aluminum foil wrapped packet he felt and later seized during a patdown search was a gun, that finding on the part of the court vitiated any then valid reason for the officer to have reached in and pulled out the object, as well as the required elements of immediate apparent identity as contraband, and the suppression of the evidence was affirmed.

        A two-pronged test has been articulated by the United States Supreme Court for determining whether an investigatory stop is permissible. First, the assessment of the situation must be based upon all the circumstances, including objective observations, information from police reports, and consideration of the patterns of operation of certain kinds of lawbreakers. From this data, a trained officer may draw inferences based upon his knowledge and experience. Second, this process must raise a suspicion that the particular individual being stopped is engaged in wrongdoing. In re John N., 463 A.2d 174,

        Since police officers were informed at roll call of drug activity occurring at a certain address, since they later observed the defendant and another person leaving that location at two o’clock in the morning, since the defendant’s companion dropped two bags of cocaine before they could be asked what they were doing in the area, and since the defendant attempted to leave the scene while his companion was being arrested, a trained and experienced law enforcement officer had reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, justifying an investigatory stop.

        Defendant’s motion to suppress was properly denied because the investigating stop and subsequent search of the van conducted by the police before defendant was arrested were constitutionally proper and justified; the officers had more than an articulable suspicion that defendant had traveled to another city to purchase drugs, and an anonymous tip was sufficiently detailed, and thereafter corroborated, to warrant an experienced detective to become reasonably suspicious of defendant’s behavior.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Sole fact that search was for easily destructible narcotics did not justify unannounced entry in violation of common-law “knock and announce” where defendant had no criminal record, officer was not refused admittance, no drugs were destroyed and no other evidence justified unannounced entry in violation of the Fourth Amendment as applied by the Fourteenth Amendment.

        An officer must first knock and announce his identity and purpose and wait a reasonable period of time before breaking into and entering premises to execute an arrest warrant. State v. Sundel,

       </p>
       <p>
        The knock and announce requirement is limited by certain qualifications and exceptions that apply under exigent circumstances. A no-knock search may be sustained, where the police, based on previous information and certain events at the scene, are confronted with an emergency situation, when approaching the premises. Thus the officer executing the warrant need not knock and announce himself when to do so would lead to the destruction of the evidence or increase the danger to the officer’s personal safety, where persons will escape and where it is evident that the officer’s purpose is known to those against whom the warrant is directed.

        Waiting five to ten seconds after an officer knocks and announces “police” before the officer forces his way into a house for which a search warrant is issued, is reasonable, where the warrant is executed at approximately 9:30 p.m., and knocking on the front door continues and remains unanswered before the officer knocks on the back door and then forces his way in. United States v. One Parcel of Real Prop. Located in City of Woonsocket, 696 F. Supp. 783, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11263 (D.R.I. 1988), aff'd, 873 F.2d 7, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 5344 (1st Cir. 1989).

       <p>
        The knock-and-announce requirement mandates that an officer must first knock and announce his or her identity and purpose and wait a reasonable length of time before he or she may break and enter into the premises to be searched. However, not every entry by police needs to be preceded by an announcement. A ruse may be necessary in order to preserve the police officer’s personal safety and to prevent the destruction of evidence by announcing police presence. State v. Mastracchio, 672 A.2d 438,

        While it is well established that only a probability and not a prima facie showing of criminal activity is the standard of probable cause, it is also clear that the record must contain evidence which would arouse something more than a mere suspicion of the guilt of the accused.

        Courts should treat with preference the drawing of inferences by a judicial officer on the basis of facts set forth in an affidavit in support of an application for a search warrant. In doubtful cases, preference must always be given to the use of warrants in order not to discourage police officers from submitting their evidence to a judicial officer before acting. State v.

        Although a court determining the existence of probable cause must view the circumstances in the context of the factual and practical considerations of everyday life, probable cause to arrest one person does not in itself constitute probable cause to arrest and search everyone else present or associating with the first individual. State v. Firth, 418 A.2d 827,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1980 R.I. LEXIS 1729

       <p>
        Probable cause exists when the facts and circumstances known by the officers and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense is being or has been committed and that the defendant has committed it. The arresting officer in the field is entitled to rely on the departmental knowledge that comes to him through official channels. State v. Firth, 418 A.2d 827,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1980 R.I. LEXIS 1729

        One of the most important elements in determining whether probable cause existed is satisfied when the police know a crime has actually been committed. State v. Frazier, 421 A.2d 546,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1980 R.I. LEXIS 1857

       <p>
        When the arrest or search is made when the police do not know that a crime has been committed, more and better evidence is needed to prove that probable cause exists for the arrest than is the case when the police do know that a crime has been committed. State v. Frazier, 421 A.2d 546,

        While a reasonable suspicion might justify a brief investigatory stop of an individual to determine his identity or momentarily to maintain the status quo, probable cause remains a prerequisite to an arrest. State v. Frazier, 421 A.2d 546,

        The crucial issue is whether at the moment of the arrest the facts and circumstances within the police officer’s knowledge and of which he had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent person’s believing that the arrestee had committed or was committing an offense. State v. Frazier, 421 A.2d 546,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1980 R.I. LEXIS 1857

       <p>
        A search warrant may not be challenged as issued without probable cause merely because one or more of the persons toward whom the probable cause pointed turned out ultimately to be innocent: any contrary rule would require the evidentiary support necessary for probable cause to rise to the level of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Kowal, 423 A.2d 1380,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1980 R.I. LEXIS 1866

       <p>
        Probable cause to arrest depends upon whether, at the moment the arrest was made, the facts and circumstances within the arresting officers’ knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the suspect had committed or was committing an offense. State v. Belcourt, 425 A.2d 1224,

        Establishing probable cause to make an arrest does not require the same degree of proof needed to determine guilt. State v. Belcourt, 425 A.2d 1224,

       <p>
        Whether information an arresting officer receives through police channels can serve as the basis for a warrantless arrest depends in part on whether the information is reasonably trustworthy. State v. Belcourt, 425 A.2d 1224,

        The “mosaic of facts and circumstances” on which the arresting officer relies in arresting a defendant may reflect the collective knowledge of the police department, as long as the arresting officer relies on that knowledge. State v. Brennan, 526 A.2d 483,

        Probable cause to arrest consists of those facts and circumstances within the police officer’s knowledge at the moment of arrest and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information that would warrant a reasonably prudent person’s believing that a crime has been committed and that the prospective arrestee has committed it.

        Police officers had probable cause to suspect that the occupants of a white Mercury Monarch had committed a crime, where the vehicle had one license plate, which constituted a violation of Rhode Island law, and police had been called to the scene of a purse snatching only moments after observing the white Mercury in a parking lot.

        Only a showing of probability, and not a prima facie showing, of criminal activity is the required standard to establish probable cause, and the issuing justice’s determination of probable cause should be paid great deference by reviewing courts. State v. Baldoni, 609 A.2d 219,

        Where the affidavit submitted in support of an apartment search warrant described the defendant’s purchase of approximately 29 pounds of marijuana and the subsequent forfeiture of approximately 26 pounds by an undercover officer to the police department, and where the affidavit further expressed the police department’s belief that the defendant “had given or sold those (missing) three pounds to person or persons unknown”, because the affidavit was devoid of any facts or other evidence to support the conclusion that the defendant had actually sold the marijuana, the issuing magistrate could reasonably conclude that the defendant had not sold or given away the drugs, but in fact still possessed them in his home.

        Where detectives collected information from three independent sources before apprehending the defendant, four informants in total, all of whom implicated the defendant in the crime charged, they had probable cause to believe that the defendant murdered the victim.

        Based on experience in narcotics, a surveillance detective determined that a suspected drug transaction had taken place between defendant and a buyer. He seized a bag suspected to be cocaine, and then relayed the information via police radio to an arresting detective who was told the location of defendant and a description of his vehicle. When the arresting officer responded to the call within minutes of the suspected drug deal, defendant’s car was still parked in the exact spot the first detective had described. The information the arresting officer received through official channels had the requisite probable cause to arrest defendant, thus, the arrest was lawful; accordingly, defendant’s extemporaneous statements were not fruits of a poisonous tree, and defendant’s motion to suppress his statements was properly denied.

        An affidavit in support of a search warrant is not fatally flawed due to a failure to contain the date of the activities therein alleged, where the affidavit is factually related to other information before the magistrate which does contain the date. United States v. Cochrane, 896 F.2d 635, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 2391 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 929, 110 S. Ct. 2627, 110 L. Ed. 2d 647, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 3029 (1990).

        Since the police had information from a confidential, reliable informant identifying the defendants as being involved in a heroin ring and predicted the defendants were going to make a sale that night, and since the defendants appeared together, acted in a suspicious manner and drove in a way obviously calculated to evade surveillance, probable cause existed to support the police stop of their vehicle and the subsequent arrests. The district court’s denial of the motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to the arrest was proper. United States v. Diallo, 29 F.3d 23, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 17511 (1st Cir. 1994).

        The totality of circumstances reported in an affidavit was sufficient to establish probable cause to search the defendant’s second floor apartment, notwithstanding that a controlled heroin buy discussed in the affidavit was not perfectly monitored and that the informant buyer did not verify the name or specific location of the seller after emerging from the building, where the buy yielded a recovery of heroin consistent with the informant’s original tip, recorded in the affidavit, that a named woman and her husband, “name unknown,” were selling heroin in the second floor apartment and, as the affidavit notes, telephone company records showed a listing for a man with the woman’s last name on the second floor of the building.

        An affidavit was not invalid for failure to particularly describe the premises to be searched, where the allegations in the affidavit amply supported the inference drawn by the issuing justice that the entire dwelling unit and both occupants were involved in the storage of stolen drugs, and the issuing justice could infer on the basis of ordinary experience in the facts of life that a person engaged in the storage of a great quantity of stolen narcotics and related substances would not place it in a portion of a single-family dwelling house without having first taken the precaution of making a confederate of his tenant; in drawing these inferences from the affidavit, the justice was following the principal that affidavits for search warrants must be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in a common sense and realistic fashion.

        Although the DEA agent had extensive training and expertise, her statements in the affidavit supporting the search warrant simply provided only generalized information regarding how drug traffickers operate; thus, the totality of the circumstances, as summarized within the four corners of the affidavit, did not give rise to a fair probability that the search of the particular location that the agent only presumed to be the suspected trafficker’s residence would uncover contraband.

        In a child pornography case in which the named subscriber of an IP address did not reside at the address listed in the warrant, nothing within the affidavit rose to the level of a knowing or intelligent false statement or one made with reckless disregard for the truth as the police were able to make a direct connection between the device using that IP address, the physical address listed in the warrant, and the downloaded child pornography; and, even if the name of the subscriber listed in the warrant affidavit was disregarded, there was probable cause for the search warrant, considering the information regarding the IP address, and the detective’s surveillance of the physical address. Thus, the family court magistrate properly denied the respondent juvenile’s request for a Franks hearing. In re Austin B., 208 A.3d 1178,

        Where a warrant apparently encompassed all documents in a party’s possession without limitation as to time or purpose, it was constitutionally invalid as unreasonable in scope and lacking in particularity of description.

        Two similar but significantly different tests must be met before a magistrate may issue a valid warrant containing only a generic description: first, the evidence presented to the magistrate must establish that there is reason to believe that a large collection of similar contraband is present on the premises to be searched, and second, the evidence before the magistrate must explain the method by which the executing agents are to differentiate the contraband from the rest of the defendant’s inventory. United States v. Cortellesso, 601 F.2d 28, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 13514 (1st Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1072, 100 S. Ct. 1016, 62 L. Ed. 2d 753, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 676 (1980).

        The requirement that the warrant itself particularly describe the material to be seized is not only to circumscribe the discretion of the executing officers but also to inform the person subject to the search and seizure what the officers are entitled to take.

        The warrant in this case was fatally flawed because it authorized the police to conduct a blanket or general search of the entire 12 acre, 18 building, 10 warehouse, 83 separate unit business complex, rented to at least 30 different tenants, and thus the evidence seized must be excluded.

        When considering whether facts alleged in a search warrant affidavit established probable cause to issue a warrant, the fact that the affidavit omitted that another person, other than defendant, lived in the house to be searched was not significant because (1) the house was a single-family home, and (2) nothing showed defendant did not control the entire house.

        Requisite nexus between contraband described in a search warrant affidavit and the place to be searched need not be based on direct observation of the suspect with the contraband at or near the area to be searched. Rather, it may be found in the type of crime, the nature of the items sought, the extent of the suspect’s opportunity for concealment, and normal inferences as to where a criminal would be likely to hide items of the sort sought in the warrant.

        Search warrant affidavit established probable cause to issue a search warrant for defendant’s residence, under the totality-of-the-circumstances test, because the confluence of an anonymous tip, twelve cut plastic baggies from defendant’s trash, cocaine residue on one baggie, defendant’s non-drug-related criminal history, and inferences therefrom showed a “fair probability” that drugs and indicia of drug distribution would be found at the residence.

        It was not error for an affidavit seeking the issuance of a warrant to search for drugs and indicia of drug distribution to describe defendant’s history of non-drug-related criminal activity because such activity was part of the totality of the circumstances considered in determining whether to issue a warrant.

        Two-month-old tip relied on to obtain a warrant to search defendant’s residence was not stale because trash seized from the residence shortly before the warrant was issued refreshed the tip, as evidence found in the trash was directly consistent with the tip. State v. Storey, 8 A.3d 454,

        When considering whether facts alleged in a search warrant affidavit established probable cause to issue a warrant, the fact that the affidavit alleged that cocaine residue was found on only one of twelve cut baggies found in defendant’s trash, which was consistent with personal use rather than distribution, was insignificant because the affidavit sought the issuance of a warrant to search for the presence of illegal narcotics, as well as any indicia of drug distribution.

        Totality of the circumstances presented in an affidavit in support of a search warrant allowed the magistrate to reasonably infer that drugs would be found in defendant’s apartment, as the affiant stated that a confidential informant reported the sale of cocaine by a black male from an apartment, and police determined that defendant was that male and lived in that apartment.

        Defendant’s motion to suppress evidence seized from his residence was properly denied, as a confidential informant’s tip that he was selling drugs from his apartment was corroborated, and this corroborated tip, combined with defendant’s recent sale of cocaine in a controlled buy, satisfied the probable cause requirement to support the search warrant.

         — Warrantless Searches.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When evidence is likely to be lost, destroyed, or removed during the time required to obtain a warrant and when, because of the circumstamces, it is difficult to secure a warrant, a warrantless entry and search may be justified. State v. Jennings, 461 A.2d 361,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1983 R.I. LEXIS 957
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1983).

       <p>
        The existence of exigent-circumstances exception to the warrant requirement encompasses the situation in which police believe a person within requires immediate assistance or other victims or intruders may still be present. State v. Jennings, 461 A.2d 361,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1983 R.I. LEXIS 957
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        A warrantless entry is permitted in an “emergency” requiring preventative action, even though no crime has been committed. The police must have an objective, reasonable belief that a crisis can only be avoided by swift and immediate action, such as where a minor is missing and is believed to be in peril. Duquette v. Godbout, 471 A.2d 1359,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1984 R.I. LEXIS 462

        Once the reason for an entry into a premises without a warrant disappears, officers no longer have any right to be on the premises. State v. Beaumier, 480 A.2d 1367,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1984 R.I. LEXIS 589

       </p>
       <p>
        Exigent circumstances occur when a reasonable officer believes that to delay acting to obtain a warrant would, in all likelihood, permanently frustrate an important police objective, such as to prevent the destruction of evidence relating to criminal activity or to secure an arrest before a suspect can commit further serious harm. United States v. Rengifo, 858 F.2d 800, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 14018 (1st Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1023, 109 S. Ct. 1752, 104 L. Ed. 2d 189, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 1847 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        A burning building clearly creates an exigency that justifies a warrantless entry by fire officials to fight a blaze. Once firefighters enter a building for this purpose, they may seize evidence of arson that is in plain view. An immediate threat that the blaze might rekindle also presents an exigency that justifies a warrantless and nonconsensual post-fire investigation. State v. Hoffman, 567 A.2d 1134,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1990 R.I. LEXIS 1
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exigency created by an explosion and fire was still present when an official investigation began, where, even though rekindling did not appear to be imminent, legitimate concerns regarding additional structural collapse did persist at the time a fire inspector began his search of the premises. State v. Hoffman, 567 A.2d 1134,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1990 R.I. LEXIS 1
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exigent circumstances justified the warrantless search of defendant’s bathroom where the police had reason to believe that defendant had lodged an extremely dangerous weapon nearby, the structure and nature of the building suggested the weapon’s ready availability to others, and the extent of the intrusion was relatively limited. United States v. Lopez, 989 F.2d 24, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 6015 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 872, 114 S. Ct. 201, 126 L. Ed. 2d 158, 1993 U.S. LEXIS 5775 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since law enforcement officers’ relevant knowledge regarding a raccoon being kept as a pet in a residence was complete almost two hours before environmental management officers arrived to seize the animal, and since the officers on the scene were not motivated by an objective or subjective belief that the animal would be spirited away or that it was imminently dangerous, there were no exigent circumstances justifying an exception to the warrant requirement. Bilida v. McCleod, 41 F. Supp. 2d 142, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 585 (D.R.I. 1999), aff'd, 211 F.3d 166, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 9136 (1st Cir. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        A second entry could not avoid the warrant requirement absent some new exigent circumstance or other excuse for failing to get a warrant since it was effected for a different reason some time after the legally entering officer had left the premises. Bilida v. McCleod, 211 F.3d 166, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 9136 (1st Cir. 2000).

        where the totality of the circumstances justified forced entry by the police and at no time during their initial search did the officers conduct an exploratory search. State v. Portes, 840 A.2d 1131,

    , 482 U.S. 691, 107 S. Ct. 2636, 96 L.

        Where a fire chief ordered his officers to deny access into or out of a building and entered areas not generally open to the public, this constituted a search and seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment, and remaining questions of material fact as to whether consent had been given and the search was reasonable required a vacation of summary judgment as to the chief.

        Where the police could have obtained a search warrant for evidence whose discovery they fully anticipated, under circumstances which indicated that no intolerable delay would have been required, the talisman excuse of police safety did not justify their excursion beyond the scope of activity necessary to effect the defendant’s arrest, and a search warrant based on their observations was likewise invalid.

       <p>
        The prohibition of this amendment is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy, and the accused whether convicted or acquitted, is equally put in jeopardy after trial on the first offense. United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 16 S. Ct. 1192, 41 L. Ed. 300, 1896 U.S. LEXIS 2296 (1896).

       <p>
        Where sentence of petitioner was to begin after expiration of prior sentence he was then erroneously thought to be serving and it was later discovered that he was not serving a prior sentence, a correction of the sentence four days later, when he was again brought before the court, did not constitute two sentences on one indictment and was not a violation of his constitutional rights under this provision. Sanford v. Langlois,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         93 R.I. 1
        </cite>

        Where defendants indicted for rape, kidnapping, sodomy and larceny pled nolo contendere pursuant to a plea bargain which provided for sentences on all four charges, and where trial judge first accepted, then revoked, the plea bargain and reinstated the not guilty pleas upon which the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of rape and kidnapping with sentences greater than those originally agreed upon in the plea bargain, upon remand by the supreme court with instructions to resentence in accordance with the original bargain, the sentencing judge could not impose the agreed-upon sentences for sodomy and larceny since defendants had been acquitted for those charges by the jury and to do so would violate the double jeopardy prohibitions of the Constitution. State v. Abbott,
        <cite class="ri_code">

        To determine whether a defendant being tried for the violation of two distinct statutory provisions which arose from the same act or transaction is being placed twice in jeopardy, the test to be applied is whether each statutory provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not. State v. Davis,
        <cite class="ri_code">

        Where appellants themselves have pressed for a mistrial, the double jeopardy clause bars a new trial only if it can be said that the government’s claimed error stemmed from bad faith, an effort to harrass or prejudice, or an attempt to provoke a mistrial. United States v. Zozlio, 617 F.2d 314, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 19534 (1st Cir. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Retrial would constitute double jeopardy where prosecutorial or judicial overreaching had caused the original mistrial. United States v. D'Alo, 486 F. Supp. 954, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10776 (D.R.I. 1980), disapproved, United States v. Motley, 655 F.2d 186, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 18136 (9th Cir. 1981); State v. Doyon, 416 A.2d 130,

       <p>
        A new information which was prompted by evidence developed a trial prior to a declaration of mistrial and which increased the potential for conviction could not be imposed in lieu of the original indictment, as it would have victimized the defendant significantly for having successfully pursued a legitmate trial tactic. United States v. D'Alo, 486 F. Supp. 954, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10776 (D.R.I. 1980), disapproved, United States v. Motley, 655 F.2d 186, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 18136 (9th Cir. 1981).

       <p>
        When the same act or transaction constitutes the violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the applicable standard is found in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932) wherein the court stated, “where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.” State v. Anthony, 422 A.2d 921,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1980 R.I. LEXIS 1852

       </p>
       <p>
        When the meaning of a criminal statute is ambiguous, the policy of lenity in the construction of criminal statutes requires that the less harsh of two possible meanings be adopted. Its purpose is to prevent the pyramiding of sentences when the penalties have not been clearly authorized. State v. Anthony, 422 A.2d 921,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1980 R.I. LEXIS 1852
        </cite>

       <p>
        The fifth amendment ban on double jeopardy is based upon the common-law pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict. Ventures Management Co. v. Geruso, 434 A.2d 252,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1254

       <p>
        The concept of double jeopardy is wholly inapplicable to the issue of civil contempt. Ventures Management Co. v. Geruso, 434 A.2d 252,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1254

       </p>
       <p>
        The standard used for determining whether an accused is in danger of being twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense is that set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932), wherein the supreme court held that: “the applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.” State v. Ballard, 439 A.2d 1375,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1982 R.I. LEXIS 796
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily, when a mistrial is granted on the defendant’s motion or with his consent the principal of double jeopardy does not bar a subsequent prosecution. State v. Sundel, 460 A.2d 939,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1983 R.I. LEXIS 954
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Double jeopardy did not bar defendant’s retrial for second-degree murder after the Supreme Court had sustained his appeal on the ground that a mistrial should have been awarded, where the prosecutor had not intended to bring about a mistrial, even though his conduct gave rise to a situation in which a mistrial should properly have been granted. State v. Diaz, 521 A.2d 129,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1987 R.I. LEXIS 418
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the granting of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal did not terminate the prosecution’s case, was never communicated to the jury which remained impaneled, and only had the effect of reducing certain charges; the granting of the motion had no effect on the continuance of the trial and submission of the case to the jury which remained impaneled, and the defendant was not faced with the threat of reprosecution in violation of double jeopardy. State v. Iovino, 524 A.2d 556,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1987 R.I. LEXIS 449
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the defendant apparently sought to promote the trial’s progression by attempting to resolve the controversy surrounding his request for his wife to assist with communication at counsel table, his failure to arrange for an interpreter, even if engendering a concern for the effectiveness of counsel and serving as a catalyst for the declaration of mistrial, cannot be construed as a request for or consent to mistrial, nor can his failure to object after the trial justice’s abrupt and unanticipated declaration of mistrial be viewed as acquiesence in the ruling. Accordingly, the mistrial cannot be said to have been declared at defendant’s behest. State v. Torres, 524 A.2d 1120,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1987 R.I. LEXIS 473
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1987).
       </p>

        The manifest-necessity standard is the proper measure of double-jeopardy protection that must be extended to a defendant absent the defendant’s request or consent, even though the trial justice, in declaring the mistrial, was motivated by desire to protect the defendant’s rights and was therefore, in effect, conferring a benefit upon the defendant. State v. Torres, 524 A.2d 1120,

        The Double Jeopardy Clause embodies three distinct safeguards for one accused of a crime. First, it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. Second, it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. Third, it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense. United States v. Abreu, 952 F.2d 1458, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 84 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 994, 112 S. Ct. 1695, 118 L. Ed. 2d 406, 1992 U.S. LEXIS 2483 (1992).

        Defendant never properly brought the defense of double jeopardy to the trial justice’s attention, nor did the facts give rise to one of the limited situations wherein the court would address a double jeopardy claim despite its improper assertion. State v. Thomas, 654 A.2d 327,

        Civil forfeitures for violations of narcotics laws are neither “punishment” nor “criminal” for purposes of double jeopardy. United States v. One Lot of $17,220, 183 F.R.D. 54 (D.R.I. 1998).

        Defendant waived an argument that convictions and separate sentences for second-degree murder and carrying a dangerous weapon in the commission of a crime of violence violated double jeopardy guarantees by failing to raise it in a pretrial motion; nonetheless, the court ruled on the merits and held in furtherance of
    Rodriguez
    , that the two crimes were separate for double jeopardy purposes as each required an element that the other did not, namely, commission of a murder and the carrying of a dangerous weapon. State v. McGuy, 841 A.2d 1109,

        Because defendant failed to raise a motion asserting the defense of double jeopardy before trial, he was precluded from thereafter raising a double jeopardy challenge; however, even if defendant’s double jeopardy contentions were properly before the court, they were without merit because the principal evil against which the Double Jeopardy Clause protects — multiple criminal punishments for the same offense — was not implicated because defendant stood convicted of (and punished for) a single offense of robbery.

        Double jeopardy was found in a particular case where, in order to prove both extortion and assault with intent to rob, the state had to demonstrate the identical elements of an intentional threat to the victim that placed him in fear of actual bodily harm, the purpose of which was to force him to give the defendant money, and proof of no additional fact was required to establish both crimes.

        Where the trial justice labored under three concerns before declaring the mistrial: Judicial economy, defendant’s potential communication problem, and absence of a prosecution witness, none of these concerns manifestly required the mistrial, since the potential length of any continuance that might be required to resolve the problems at hand did not warrant the jury’s dismissal, the communication problem was resolved with a continuance that merely extended from midpoint in the court’s afternoon session to the next morning, a loss of only a few hours, the record was devoid of any indication that the witness problem required a continuance, given that the prosecution had other witnesses to call, or if it did require a continuance, that the continuance would be lengthy, and the reason for the witness’s absence was minor and on its face easily resolvable within a brief period. Hence, the mistrial was improperly declared under the manifest-necessity standard, and further prosecution would violate the imperative ban against double jeopardy. State v. Torres, 524 A.2d 1120,

        The state’s appeal from an order granting the defendant’s motion to dismiss does not violate double jeopardy where the agreed statement of facts between the parties stipulates that the facts are only to be considered for a pretrial determination and the defendant specifically reserves the right to a jury trial.

        Where the same set of facts give rise to the charges as contained in counts 2, 4, and 7 of a criminal information lodged against a defendant, who argues that the information is multiplicious and a violation of his Federal and State Constitutional protections against double jeopardy and that counts 4 and 7 are lesser included offenses of count 2 and do not require proof of any additional facts, the trial justice is correct in denying the defendant’s motion to compel election because the state can prove any one of the charges at trial if the evidence elicited supports a guilty verdict, and because the defendant can adequately prepare a defense, as he is effectively put on notice of the possible conviction of a lesser offense supported by the evidence.

        The double jeopardy clause did not bar the state from prosecuting a juvenile defendant in the superior court following his participation in a waiver-of-jurisdiction hearing in the family court, since the double-jeopardy clause applies only to proceedings that are “essentially criminal”, subjecting the defendant to the possibility of punitive incarceration.

        Where the sentencing judge found a defendant’s admission of perjury to be evidence of remorse and a mitigating factor in her sentencing decision, a subsequent trial court’s decision to grant a motion to dismiss a criminal information for perjury on double jeopardy grounds was error, since the information was not a prosecution for the same offense for which the defendant had been convicted previously, nor had the defendant ever been punished previously for his admitted perjury.

        Dual convictions for carrying a dangerous weapon when committing a crime of violence and first-degree robbery did not constitute a double jeopardy violation because each offense included an additional element of proof that was not contained in the other; the jury could have returned a verdict of guilty on the robbery charge based on either defendant’s use of a dangerous weapon or the injury inflicted upon the victim, while the conviction for committing a crime of violence while armed or having available a firearm did not require that the weapon be used or that there be an injury to the victim.

        When the defendant was convicted of different crimes in different courts and, while on probation for both sentences, is charged with committing a new offense, the state was required to file Super. Ct. R. Crim. Pro. Rule 32(f) violation reports in both the District and Superior Courts, since only the sentencing court has the authority to reinstate previously imposed suspended sentences. Furthermore, such a requirement does not violate the double jeopardy clause, which prohibits multiple prosecutions for the same offense, since a violation hearing is not a prosecution but is civil in nature. State v. Pinney, 672 A.2d 870,

        Collateral estoppel, under U.S. Const. amend. V, did not bar State from prosecuting defendant for firearms violations because, although the offenses had been tried in a probation violation hearing, an appeals court had quashed that judgment; thus it was a nullity and had no preclusive effect.

        Where the judge erroneously revokes counsel’s permission to appear, then asks the defendant whether he wishes to proceed, represent himself, or obtain other counsel, and the defendant says he would like to engage other counsel, the judge may then take the case from the jury and set a new trial date. The new trial does not violate the protection against double jeopardy provided by this amendment. The important consideration, for purposes of the double jeopardy clause, is that the defendant retain primary control over the course to be followed after a serious trial court error, and unless the judge’s action is motivated by bad faith or undertaken to harass or prejudice the defendant, the double jeopardy clause does not prevent a retrial as long as the defendant is offered the choice of continuing. Sundel v. Justices of Superior Court, 728 F.2d 40, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 24969 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 827, 105 S. Ct. 108, 83 L. Ed. 2d 52, 1984 U.S. LEXIS 3185 (1984).

        Defendant’s retrial did not violate the double jeopardy clause on the premise that the evidence at his original trial was “legally insufficient” to sustain his conviction, where there was never a finding that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the conviction. United States v. Arache, 946 F.2d 129, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 22932 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 948, 112 S. Ct. 1507, 117 L. Ed. 2d 645, 1992 U.S. LEXIS 1898 (1992).

        A retrial following a mistrial was not barred, where the record did not indicate any attempt by the prosecution or the court to goad defendant into seeking a mistrial. State v. Mallett, 604 A.2d 1263,
        <cite class="ri_code">

        Where the prosecution inadvertently failed to disclose relevant information to the defendants and the trial judge granted a mistrial after finding that manifest necessity had been established, the motion justice who denied the defendant’s motion to dismiss the retrial on double jeopardy grounds properly found that the trial justice acted out of manifest necessity given that the proceeding at best would have produced a verdict that could have been upset at will by one of the parties. State v. Bereube, 609 A.2d 961,
        <cite class="ri_code">

        Since the trial justice, in granting a new trial for the defendant convicted of assault with intent to commit sexual assault, specifically assessed the credibility of the witnesses and determined that he did not believe certain witnesses who claimed that the defendant was essentially sober and was thus capable of forming a specific intent, the justice was acting as a thirteenth juror. The justice did not determine that the evidence was legally insufficient, as would have been the case had he granted a judgment of acquittal. Therefore, double jeopardy principles did not bar a second trial. State v. Laperche, 617 A.2d 1371,
        <cite class="ri_code">

        Although first-degree murder and second-degree murder constitute the “same offense” under Rhode Island law, the defendant’s retrial for second-degree murder, the lesser-included offense, following his acquittal on the charge of first-degree murder, did not violate his constitutional rights against double jeopardy, since first-degree murder also requires proof of premeditation of more than a momentary duration and proof of deliberation, whereas second-degree murder does not, thus satisfying the applicable “same evidence” test. State v. Grabowski, 644 A.2d 1282,

        Reprosecution was not barred since the prosecution did not in any way deliberately intend to cause the resulting mistrial by eliciting improper testimony from a state trooper on the witness stand. State v. Beltre, 764 A.2d 190,

       <p>
        Retrial on the charge of kidnapping did not violate double jeopardy, as there was not abuse of discretion by the trial judge when he determined that the jury was “genuinely deadlocked” after he had made a prudent examination of the jury’s progress, provided supplemental instructions, and requested that the jurors return to deliberations for a reasonable period. State v. Gordon, 30 A.3d 636,

        Defendant’s right to be free from double jeopardy was not violated because he merely asserted that admitting the acquitted conduct into evidence, under

        (b), would force him to relitigate issues already decided by a valid judgment of acquittal, but defendant did not argue that the jury in the first trial necessarily decided the ultimate issue in count five, one of the first-degree sexual assault counts, which resulted in a deadlocked jury and was the only count for which the State sought a retrial; and his argument that admitting the acquitted conduct into evidence would force defendant to relitigate those same issues already decided by a valid judgment of acquittal conflated a double jeopardy contention with one that was evidentiary.

        The prinicipal demarcation between criminal and civil contempt for purposes of the ban on double jeopardy is that in criminal contempt the purpose of sanctions imposed is to punish the contemnor for action in derogation of the authority and dignity of the court itself, whereas in civil contempt the purpose of the sanction imposed is to coerce the defendant into compliance with the court order and to compensate the complaining party for losses sustained as a result of the violation of the court order.

        In determining whether the lineup identification procedure violated a defendant’s due process rights, a two-part test is employed. First, whether the makeup of the lineup and the procedure utilized in the subsequent identification process were unnecessarily or impressibly suggestive must be considered. Second, if the lineup and identification is found to have used any unnecessary or improper suggestiveness, then the court must undertake to determine if any identification made has independent reliability, despite the suggestive nature of the lineup.

Defendant was not entitled to the defense of outrageous government conduct in a situation where the State brokered an agreement with an attorney to grant transactional immunity to a witness in exchange for information leading to defendant’s arrest and indictment despite the fact that the attorney later represented defendant in the same matter; since the attorney was not in a client relationship with defendant when the agreement with the witness was brokered and since it was the witness and not the attorney who gave the government information, the government committed no misconduct and did not interfere with defendant’s attorney-client relationship.

        Deportable aliens, those who have been ordered deported after having gained admission to the United States, are afforded greater procedural and substantive due process rights than excludable aliens, those who have sought admission to the country but have not secured it. Hermanowski v. Farquharson, 39 F. Supp. 2d 148, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2240 (D.R.I. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a substantive due process violation is to be found in the practice of detention pending deportation, it can only be based upon a finding that the detention, under a particular set of factual circumstances, is excessive in relation to the governmental purposes behind the restriction. Hermanowski v. Farquharson, 39 F. Supp. 2d 148, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2240 (D.R.I. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the plaintiff’s fifth amendment substantive due process claim in his habeas corpus petition did not implicate the adequacy of the procedures afforded him by the federal immigration statute or the validity of the decision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in applying the provisions of that statute, he was not statutorily required to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to seeking judicial relief. Hermanowski v. Farquharson, 39 F. Supp. 2d 148, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2240 (D.R.I. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since there existed the potential for many more years of detention while awaiting the occurrence of the remote possibility of deportation, due to the refusal of the potential country of destination to accept the deportee, and since the danger posed by the deportee was of the milder sort, in that his convictions were for purse-snatching and low-level narcotics violations, the continued physical detention of the deportee in a prison pending deportation was excessive in relation to the governmental objectives that regulatory detention sought to advance. Hermanowski v. Farquharson, 39 F. Supp. 2d 148, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2240 (D.R.I. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because continued detention by the INS did not serve a legitimate government interest since there was little possibility that the detainee would be deported in the foreseeable future, the absolute restraint on his personal freedom constituted a violation of his right to liberty.

        The constitutional privilege against self-incrimination extends not only to disclosures that would support a conviction but also to disclosures that would constitute a link in a chain of evidence needed to initiate a prosecution. Roberts v. Communications Inv. Club, 431 A.2d 1206,

        Although it is true that the privilege against self-incrimination should be upheld if the answer to a question would create a link in a chain of evidence which might be utilized in order to prosecute the witness for criminal conduct, it is necessary that the trial justice make a determination of whether relevant questions could have a reasonable possibility of establishing the hazard of incrimination.

        Once it is clear from the implications of the question in the setting in which it is asked that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because an injurious disclosure could result, it is the duty of the court to refrain from placing upon the witness the burden of establishing the incriminatory nature of responses to the question by making disclosures that in themselves would be incriminatory.

        Prosecutor’s statement during closing argument that a government theory had gone uncontested in cross-examination came “perilously close” to commenting on defendant’s failure to testify on his own behalf, since defendant was the only witness whose testimony could have refuted the theory; however, the prosecutor’s remarks fell short of reversible error because they were limited to the failure of defense to refute government arguments in cross-examination, and because the trial judge issued appropriate instructions.

        Assessment of the propriety of prosecutorial argument to a jury requires review of the questioned statement in context and in light of attendant circumstances, rather than in isolation, and ascertainment of its meaning not in how it is read from the printed page, but in how a jury composed of ordinarily intelligent lay persons would understand it as they listened to the prosecutor’s closing argument.

        The prosecutor’s remark during closing argument employing the term “unexplained” did not impermissibly comment on the defendant’s failure to testify as the remark was clearly aimed at the evidence in order to advance certain inferences, and not at the defendant. United States v. Akinola, 985 F.2d 1105, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 1554 (1st Cir. 1993).

       <p>
        The trial justice’s comments to defense counsel regarding the defendant’s failure to testify were a candid assessment that the defendant’s admissions of guilt, brought out through the state’s witnesses, remained uncontradicted except for any inconsistencies that could be found in the witnesses’ testimony. These comments, when viewed in context, did not deprive the defendant of his Fifth Amendment privilege, particularly when the trial justice continually reiterated to the jury that the defendant had the right not to testify. State v. Tempest, 651 A.2d 1198,
        <cite class="ri_code">

        After a police officer made an unsolicited remark that defendant remained silent after he had been informed of his Miranda rights, the trial court did not err in refusing to declare a mistrial, as it immediately provided the jury with a thorough curative instruction that foreclosed any prejudice to defendant that may have arisen. State v. Enos, 21 A.3d 326,

        Prosecutor’s statement that there was no evidence before the jury that the sex was consensual, including none from defendant, taken in context, did not violate defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights as the prosecutor’s comment did not implicate defendant’s right to remain silent. Given the broader context of the comment, the prosecutor’s statement was not of such a character that a jury would naturally and necessarily have construed it to amount to a comment on the failure of the accused to testify; further, the portion of the general instructions pertaining to defendant’s right not to testify adequately expressed that he had every right to remain silent, and admonished that such a choice could not be held against him.

        Possible commitment to a treatment facility after expiration of a term of confinement to a juvenile facility was not a threat of prosecution to which the self-incrimination privilege attached; therefore, a juvenile serial killer could not refuse to cooperate with a psychiatric treatment plan on grounds of self-incrimination, and the failure to cooperate was punishable by imprisonment for criminal contempt.

        Confessions remain a proper element in law enforcement. Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence. Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by the holding in Miranda. State v. Perez, 422 A.2d 913,

        Any conviction based in whole or in part upon an involuntary confession, regardless of its truth or falsity, deprived a defendant of due process of law and, therefore must be reversed. State v. Fuentes, 433 A.2d 184,

        Where the Supreme Court must conclude as a matter of fact that defendant was brought involuntarily to the police station for interrogation even though the police did not suspect him and had no probable cause to believe that he was guilty of a crime, the trial justice’s finding that his statements were voluntary for Fifth Amendment purposes was insufficient to overcome the Fourth Amendment violation.

        Separate hearing was not required to determine whether probationer’s statements admitting criminal conduct were voluntary and admissible; the exclusionary rule had no application in a revocation proceeding, since it was civil in nature, and there was no evidence indicating the statements were anything but voluntary.

        Where defendant’s confession was obtained while defendant was being detained as the result of an illegal arrest, the state not only had the initial burden of showing that defendant’s statements met the voluntariness standards required by this amendment but also had the burden of demonstrating that the causal connection between the statements and the illegal arrest was broken so as to dispel the primary taint of the illegal seizure.

        Even if the defendant’s mental state was impaired at the time he confessed to the crimes charged, that was irrelevant to the question of the voluntariness of the confession because that confession was not induced by the police or by any other state actor. State v. Brouillard, 745 A.2d 759,

        The totality of the circumstances surrounding defendant’s confession supported the trial court’s finding that it was a voluntary act, since the late night arrest and early morning interrogation were not the product of coercive police tactics, but merely reflected the vicissitudes of the investigation and the fortuitous, late-in-the-day timing of the various events leading up to the arrest, and since the defendant was provided with his rights three times during the three hours between the arrest and the interview.

        The defendant’s confession was not coerced, notwithstanding that he was in custody when he confessed to a detective and that a sizable team of police officers, plus a dog, was present in the apartment with him at the same time, where the record established that the police did not apply undue or unusual pressure to him, use coercive tactics, or threaten him with violence or retaliation if he did not confess.

        Where a murder suspect who struck all who observed him as highly intelligent reserved as many as six Miranda cautions during the period in which he was giving statements to police, and executed waivers after each caution, there was no question that he was eager to talk about what he had done, and that his statements, like the waivers, were voluntary and admissible.

        Defendant’s confession was properly not suppressed as a hearing justice did not credit defendant’s testimony that the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families threatened to take defendant’s children if defendant did not give a police statement; defendant voluntarily waived defendant’s right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V, and

        It was not error to deny defendant’s motion to suppress defendant’s confession made during an interrogation at a police station because it was not clear error to find the confession was made after defendant voluntarily waived defendant’s Miranda rights, as (1) defendant’s counsel admitted defendant was not forced to make the confession, (2) the evidence was undisputed that defendant was not threatened, defendant never said defendant was confused or felt pressured, defendant never asked to stop questioning, and defendant never requested an attorney, and (3) any limits on defendant’s understanding of English had little bearing on the validity of defendant’s Miranda waiver, as defendant was advised of those rights in defendant’s first language.

         — Interrogation.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The Miranda safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent; that is, the term “interrogation” under Miranda refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating reponse from the suspect. Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 94 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Not all statements obtained by the police after a person has been taken into custody are to be considered the product of interrogation; rather, “interrogation” must reflect a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody itself. Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 94 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no “interrogation” within the meaning of Miranda where police officers transporting an arrested defendant to the station conversed briefly among themselves but within the defendant’s hearing about the need to find the murder weapon, believed to be located in the vicinity of a school for handicapped children; the fact that the officers’ comments struck a responsive chord in the defendant, who then located the shotgun for the police, did not decide the matter where it was not established that the police should have known that their words were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 94 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The definitions of “interrogation” under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, if indeed the term “interrogation” is even apt in the Sixth Amendment context, are not necessarily interchangeable since the policies underlying the two constitutional protections are quite distinct. Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 94 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Custody alone, without some police action that might amount to interrogation, does not involve the type of inherent coercion attending custodial interrogation which the supreme court in Miranda and its progeny sought to mitigate. State v. Gelinas, 417 A.2d 1381,
        <cite class="ri_code">

        A defendant may not invoke the Fifth Amendment to bar the admission of incriminating statements unless such statements are the product of custodial interrogation. State v. Perez, 422 A.2d 913,

        To determine whether or not a statement was the product of police interrogation, the reviewing court must independently examine the facts, findings and the record of the lower court. State v. Perez, 422 A.2d 913,

        The reading of a rights form which advised a defendant that he was a suspect in a criminal investigation but did not accuse him of the crime being investigated was not the functional equivalent of interrogation and statements made by the defendant were admissible against him.

        Defendant’s expression of a desire to speak to “someone” did not act to invoke his right to the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation. State v. Killay, 430 A.2d 418,

        The defendant, who was questioned by FBI agents in her home between 8:00 and 8:30 a.m., was not “in custody” for Miranda purposes, even though she was not told that she was free to leave or terminate questioning, did not eat or go to the bathroom during the entire morning, and was asked to provide handwriting exemplars for comparison with forged checks.

        Since
    Miranda
    warnings are necessary only when a suspect is in official custody, subject to questioning by law-enforcement officials, their agents, or agents of the court, the questioning of a student by a principal after a fight as part of the school’s policy to call students involved in fights to the principal’s office, and after a police officer had left the school grounds without asking the principal to speak to the student, did not render the principal an agent of law enforcement, and did not require that the student be informed of his rights prior to the questioning.

        Defendant’s oral, written and taped custodial statements were properly admitted into evidence since he never raised the issue of suppression at any time during the course of the lower court proceedings, since he never raised any question concerning mental illness or impairment affecting his interrogation, and since there was no indication on the record that he requested privacy during the time he made telephone calls.

        The right against self-incrimination is personal; it cannot be invoked or waived by anyone other than the person to whom the right attaches. Therefore, even if police conduct infringes on an existing attorney-client relationship, it cannot violate the accused’s fifth amendment right not to incriminate himself unless the conduct itself somehow affects the accused’s capacity to invoke his rights. Fuentes v. Moran, 572 F. Supp. 1461, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13405 (D.R.I. 1983), aff'd, 733 F.2d 176, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 22782 (1st Cir. 1984).

        Defendant’s statement to police sergeant that he had nothing to say at that time, which the officer interpreted to mean that defendant did not know anything concerning the event about which he was being questioned, did not amount to invocation of his right to remain silent.

       <p>
        Even though a witness’s invocation of the fifth amendment may have added weight to the prosecutor’s case against the defendant, the prejudice, if any, to the defendant is minimal, where the prosecutor does not attempt to use the witness’s brief appearance to the government’s advantage and does not refer to it during the trial.

        Where, in a civil case there is no indication in the record that the trial justice is provided with any factual basis for evaluating whether defendants’ testimony or production of documents would be potentially incriminating, the mere threat of criminal prosecution is insufficient to justify a blanket assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege.

        The doctrine that after

        Where defendant, given Miranda warnings, was exercising his rights by waiting to consult counsel, further police questioning could not be justified as having been initiated by waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination and right to counsel when defendant remarked only that he was in a jam. State v. Lachapelle,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         112 R.I. 105

        (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant had waived his Miranda rights, his subsequent refusal to answer certains questions posed to him by a federal agent did not represent a reassertion of his right to remain silent without some affirmative indication that that was his intention; thus, the prosecution was entitled to introduce defendant’s statement along with the questions he refused to answer and to comment on those refusals. United States v. Goldman, 563 F.2d 501, 1977 U.S. App. LEXIS 11166 (1st Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1067, 98 S. Ct. 1245, 55 L. Ed. 2d 768, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 727 (1978).

        The determination of whether statements made during custodial interrogation are admissible against the accused is to be made upon an inquiry into the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation in order to ascertain whether the accused in fact knowingly and voluntarily decided to waive his rights to remain silent and to have the assistance of counsel. State v. Benton, 413 A.2d 104,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1980 R.I. LEXIS 1517

       <p>
        The trial justice must conduct a preliminary hearing in the jury’s absence to determine if the confession obtained was in violation of a defendant’s rights against self-incrimination; if the evidence is introduced at trial, the trial justice must then instruct the members of the jury to make their independent determination. State v. Bello, 417 A.2d 902,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1980 R.I. LEXIS 1715

        (R.I. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial justice’s ruling on the question of waiver will not be disturbed unless an independent examination of the record of the motion to suppress, such examination made in the light most favorable to the state, discloses that the ruling was clearly erroneous. State v. Proulx, 419 A.2d 835,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1980 R.I. LEXIS 1834

        (R.I. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although not dispositive of the question of waiver, an express written statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or of the right to counsel is usually strong proof of the validity of that waiver. State v. Proulx, 419 A.2d 835,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1980 R.I. LEXIS 1834

       <p>
        If the trial justice finds that the police have informed the accused of his rights as mandated by Miranda, he must explore the totality of the circumstances attending the accused’s statement to determine whether the accused did legitimately waive his constitutional rights. State v. Proulx, 419 A.2d 835,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1980 R.I. LEXIS 1834

        A waiver of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is not likely to be inferred. Roberts v. Communications Inv. Club, 431 A.2d 1206,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1180
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        To waive the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination or any other fundamental constitutional right, one must intentionally relinquish or abandon a known right or privilege. Roberts v. Communications Inv. Club, 431 A.2d 1206,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1180

        (R.I. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial justice denied defendant’s assertion of his privilege against self-incrimination but the same information the questions sought to elicit was eventually placed before the trial justice by independent evidence, even if it was error for the trial justice to compel defendant to answer questions posed to him after he had asserted his privilege against self-incrimination, such error was harmless. Roberts v. Communications Inv. Club, 431 A.2d 1206,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1180

        (R.I. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In making an assessment about whether or not there has been a valid waiver by the defendant of his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, the trial justice has to consider the totality of the relevant circumstances existing at the time the confession was made. State v. Carlson, 432 A.2d 676,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1227
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The prosecution bears a heavy burden in establishing that an accused waived his privilege against compelled self-incrimination and his right to counsel. State v. Fuentes, 433 A.2d 184,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1493
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since no constitutional infraction automatically takes place when the police question a suspect who they have reason to know is represented by counsel, none ipso facto occurs merely because of neglect to inform the suspect of an attempt by an attorney to contact him. Rather, the relationship of the suspect to the attorney, the extent of the knowledge enjoyed by the authorities, the nature of the lawyer’s request, and all kindred factors, become part and parcel of the “totality of the circumstances” which must in all events be sifted and weighed in determining whether or not a free and sentient waiver of the rights to remain silent and to the presence of an attorney has been effectuated. Fuentes v. Moran, 572 F. Supp. 1461, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13405 (D.R.I. 1983), aff'd, 733 F.2d 176, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 22782 (1st Cir. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure of police officers to volunteer to defendant that his lawyer had made a half-hearted inquiry as to defendant’s custodial status did not constitute trickery and did not vitiate defendant’s waiver of his fifth amendment rights. Fuentes v. Moran, 733 F.2d 176, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 22782 (1st Cir. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant legitimately waived his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination where the defendant confessed after the police had twice previously read the defendant his rights and provided him a written rights-notification form, which he signed. Once the police had ascertained that the defendant understood his rights, they were under no obligation to also ask if the defendant desired to waive his rights before accepting his statement. State v. White, 512 A.2d 1370,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1986 R.I. LEXIS 530
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s prior involvement in the criminal justice system was “telling evidence” that the constitutional warnings given him by the police were understood and that his waiver was knowingly and intelligently made. State v. Ferola, 518 A.2d 1339,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1986 R.I. LEXIS 561
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant’s waiver of Miranda rights was both knowing and intelligent even if, as defendant contended, he could not speak fluent English and did not understand the full consequences of making a statement to the police, where he was advised of his rights in his native tongue and claimed to understand such rights. State v. Leuthavone, 640 A.2d 515,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1994 R.I. LEXIS 119

        (R.I. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial justice correctly concluded that a Cuban-born defendant who had resided in the United States for 10 years and appeared to communicate successfully with non-Spanish speakers, was sufficiently fluent in the English language to have waived his Miranda rights knowingly and intelligently. State v. Garcia, 643 A.2d 180,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1994 R.I. LEXIS 182

        Where, before the defendant was brought to the videotaping room, he was advised of his rights, he initialed statements given to him indicating that he understood each statement and then signed the form, and his mother signed as a witness, having been informed that her son’s rights applied to her as well, these facts, taken together with the fact that the seventeen-year-old defendant was living on his own with his girlfriend and their son, drove a car, and had held a couple of jobs, supported the finding that the defendant was apprised of his rights and, on the basis of the totality of the circumstances, had waived them knowingly and voluntarily. State v. Kryla, 742 A.2d 1178,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1999 R.I. LEXIS 224

        Defendant, a juvenile, knowingly and voluntarily waived defendant’s
    Miranda
    rights in accordance with U.S. Const. amend. V, despite the police detective’s failure to determine defendant’s reading-comprehension ability; no evidence was presented to suggest that defendant had cognitive problems, and the warnings were read to defendant in addition to defendant reading them. In re Joseph B., 822 A.2d 172,
        <cite class="ri_code">

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s statements to police regarding a killing that occurred while defendant was engaged in a gang fight were voluntary because defendant was advised of defendant’s Miranda rights, defendant’s guardian was present during the interview and allowed to converse with defendant privately at several points during the interview, defendant did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and a detective testified that no one made any promises to defendant or otherwise coerced defendant into waiving defendant’s Miranda rights.

        Denial of request that nurse be permitted to sit alongside defendant’s counsel during medical testimony was not a denial of any right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. State v. Carvalho,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         122 R.I. 461
        </cite>
        , 409 A.2d 132,

       <p>
        The definitions of “interrogation” under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, if indeed the term “interrogation” is even apt in the Sixth Amendment context, are not necessarily interchangeable since the policies underlying the two constitutional protections are quite distinct. Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 94 (1980).

        Explicit guarantees of this amendment attach at initiation of judicial criminal proceedings. In re Daniel T., 446 A.2d 1042,

        This provision is not violated by reading in evidence on a second trial a transcribed copy of the stenographic notes of the reporter of the testimony of a witness who had died after the first trial. Mattox v. United States, 156 U.S. 237, 15 S. Ct. 337, 39 L. Ed. 409, 1895 U.S. LEXIS 2131 (1895), limited, Carver v. United States, 164 U.S. 694, 17 S. Ct. 228, 41 L.

        An act of congress declaring that a judgment of conviction against the principal felons shall be evidence in the prosecution against the receiver that property of the United States was embezzled or stolen, violates this amendment. Kirby v. United States, 174 U.S. 47, 19 S. Ct. 574, 43 L. Ed. 890, 1899 U.S. LEXIS 1481 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        The admission in evidence of a statement or deposition of a co-defendent taken at the examining trial violates the right of a defendant to be confronted with the witnesses against him where the failure of the witness to appear at the trial to testify in person is plainly due to the negligence of the prosecution. Motes v. United States, 178 U.S. 458, 20 S. Ct. 993, 44 L. Ed. 1150, 1900 U.S. LEXIS 1694 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        Accused does not have the right under this amendment to be advised of the names of witnesses who were before the grand jury. Wilson v. United States, 221 U.S. 361, 31 S. Ct. 538, 55 L. Ed. 771, 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1740 (1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        Introduction of letters of persons not examined as witnesses did not constitute a denial of the right to be confronted with the witnesses where the accused had answered the letters. Salinger v. United States, 272 U.S. 542, 47 S. Ct. 173, 71 L. Ed. 398, 1926 U.S. LEXIS 22 (1926).

       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with first degree murder of a woman, and his alleged accomplice, who had pleaded guilty to second degree murder of the same deceased, was permitted to testify against him, defendant had no standing to object by virtue of his sixth amendment right of confrontation, since the alleged accomplice testified in the presence of defendant who cross-examined him. State v. Espinosa,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         109 R.I. 221

        Where an out-of-court statement referred to threats of future conduct of defendant, where the state of mind of the victim was placed in issue by the defense to show a friendly relationship between victim and defendant, and where defendant made no attempt to show whether the circumstances indicated the statement was reasonably trustworthy, there was no error in admitting the hearsay as rebuttal evidence. State v. Patriarca,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         112 R.I. 14

        Defendant was not deprived of right of confrontation by denial of his pretrial motion for severance where evidence of an out-of-court conversation implicating defendant was admitted at trial, defendant cross-examined one of the participants as to whether the statement had in fact been made, there were no circumstances rendering suspect the reliability of declarant’s statement, and statement was not devastatingly incriminating.

        The fact that informer did not testify against defendant on drug charge did not deprive defendant of his right to confrontation where the informer was not the accuser and where state was unable to locate the informer. Frazier v. Howard,

        Where the confession of a joint defendant who did not take the stand was introduced in evidence after the deletion of all references to the other two defendants, the court held that, since the two defendants’ connection with the confessing defendant was established by the independent testimony of two witnesses who were fully cross-examined, their constitutional right to confront witnesses under this amendment and former

        Although generally a defendant has a constitutional right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, to cross-examine a prosecution witness as to his present residence, without any obligation to explain the purpose of the questioning, where the personal safety of the witness is involved, the witness has been placed in his proper setting or environment and the defendant fails to demonstrate he has suffered any harm from the failure to disclose the witness’ exact address, such cross-examination may be properly excluded.

        A critical issue in determining the right to confrontation is always the availability of a witness. In respect to availability, a threshold determination must be made by the tribunal. If the witness is unavailable, then the tribunal may consider other elements such as reliability and evidentiary exceptions to the hearsay rule. It may also consider the effect of a statement against penal interest in determining reliability. State v. DeRoche,
        <cite class="ri_code">

        In its enforcement of the confrontation clause, the Supreme Court of the United States has not manifested an intention to freeze at a given point in time the development of exceptions to the exclusionary hearsay rules where indicia of reliability would justify such exceptions, even though they constitute a departure from traditional evidentiary rules.

        Where trial was started while defendant was not present, over the objection of defendant’s counsel, and during defendant’s absence the only witness who saw defendant in possession of a handgun testified, and when defendant arrived in courtroom trial justice refused to allow defense counsel to proffer any explanation for defendant’s absence, a new trial was required.

        In comparison to the right to call witnesses, confrontation and cross-examination present greater hazards to institutional interests. La Plante v. Southworth, 484 F. Supp. 115, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9904 (D.R.I. 1980).

        The better course at this time, in a period where prison practices are diverse and somewhat experimental, is to leave matters of confrontation and cross-examination to the sound discretion of the officials of state prisons.

        Within the reasonable limitations necessary in the prison disciplinary context, there is no requirement but merely a suggestion that a disciplinary committee state its reason for refusing to call a witness, whether it be irrelevance, lack of necessity or the hazards presented in the individual case.

        A trial justice did not abuse his discretion so as to violate defendant’s rights to confrontation and cross-examination by limiting cross-examination of a witness to those matters which had been testified to on direct examination. State v. Benevides, 420 A.2d 65,
        <cite class="ri_code">

        The exercise of discretion by the trial justice in limiting the scope of cross-examination will not be disturbed except for clear abuse, and then only when such abuse constitutes prejudicial error. State v. Anthony, 422 A.2d 921,

       <p>
        Questions exceeding the proper limits of cross-examination are those that harass, annoy, or humiliate the witness, or questions that are irrelevant or offer no probative value. Questions of this nature are subject to the control of the trial justice. State v. Anthony, 422 A.2d 921,

       <p>
        Although the supreme court of the United States has ruled that a probationer or a parolee had a right at a revocation hearing to confront and cross-examine witnesses, the right of confrontation is satisfied if the trial justice has determined that the out-of-court declarant is available for cross-examination. State v. Potter, 423 A.2d 67,

       <p>
        If the out-of-court declarant is not available for cross-examination, then the trial justice is to make a specific finding that there is just cause for not permitting confrontation before the hearsay testimony is admitted into evidence. State v. Potter, 423 A.2d 67,

        A defendant is entitled to cross-examine a witness granted immunity with regard to his bias or interest in testifying on behalf of the state, and this encompasses the nature of the immunity agreement and any additional promises made to or understandings reached with the witness.

        Where prosecution witness refused at defendant’s trial to repeat his testimony given against defendant at earlier bail hearing, introduction of earlier testimony at trial was error where defendant had not been allowed at bail hearing to cross-examine witness regarding effect of promise of immunity on witness’s motivation to testify and where defendant cited circumstances affirmatively demonstrating untrustworthiness of the earlier testimony. State v. Anthony, 448 A.2d 744,

        To support a finding that a witness is unavailable due to illness, expert testimony must establish that the witness’s illness makes testifying relatively impossible, not merely inconvenient. State v. Hannagan, 473 A.2d 291,

        Where the sole witness’ credibility was a vital element in establishing defendant’s guilt and where the trial justice precluded the defendant from raising and probing the issues of motive, bias, or prejudice, effectively cutting off defendant’s right to test the witness’ credibility, the defendant’s constitutional right to confrontation was abrogated. State v. Freeman, 473 A.2d 1149,

       <p>
        Since the purpose of cross-examination is to impeach a witness’s credibility, the general rule that confines the scope of cross-examination to facts brought out during direct examination is inapplicable when the questions are designed either to explain, contradict, or discredit any testimony given by the witness on direct examination or to test his accuracy, memory, veracity, or credibility. State v. Soto, 477 A.2d 945,

        The partiality of a witness may be explored at trial, and is always relevant for the purposes of discrediting a witness and thereby affecting the weight of his testimony; however, this does not permit a defendant to introduce evidence which is irrelevant to showing a witness’s purported bias.

        Right of a defendant in a criminal case to establish the motives of the witnesses against him, such as prejudice, bias, or interest, is an important component of this amendment’s right of confrontation. State v. Beaumier, 482 A.2d 1199,

        The right of cross-examination is a primary interest secured by the confrontation clause and the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested; the scope of this right, however, is a matter of judicial discretion; and it does not include the right to ask repetitive questions.

        Defendant’s state and federal constitutional rights to confrontation were not violated by the restriction of defense counsel’s cross-examination of a police officer who was the first to arrive at the scene of the murder where defendant’s purpose in attempting the cross-examination (to highlight the racial overtones of the entire incident) was ultimately served by the admission of other evidence.

        Where the only evidence defendant was allowed to place before the jury regarding a witness’s mental condition was that he had a “problem” with his memory and defense counsel was not permitted to elicit from the witness for the benefit of the jury the witness’s treatment for premature Alzheimer’s disease and the many other different conditions for which he was being treated, applying the harmless-error analysis to the facts, and particularly those elements of cross-examination that were not permitted concerning witness’s mental disease and the inferences that might be drawn therefrom, the error was not only harmless beyond a reasonable doubt but was extremely harmful to the development of defendant’s defense by restricting his ability to attack the credibility of the most important witness presented in support of the charges against him.

        In a prosecution for sexual assault, the trial justice does not impermissibly limit the cross-examination of the complaining witness, even though defense counsel’s cross-examination of the victim may not have been as effective as he would have desired, where a significant cross-examination of the victim is allowed, and there is corroborating testimony from two other witnesses.

        A state witness, on cross-examination, disclosed his substantial criminal record, including the fact that at the time of his testimony he was on probation and was subject to a deferred sentence. Only when defense counsel attempted to elicit the witness’s understanding of what a deferred sentence entailed did the trial justice sustain the state’s objections. By that point in the cross-examination defendant’s constitutional right to confrontation had been amply satisfied, and the trial justice’s decision to limit questioning could not be considered an abuse of discretion.

        In a prosecution for sexual assault, admitting video-taped testimony of out-of-state physicians taken while the defendant is absent from the courtroom does not violate the defendant’s constitutional right to confront witnesses, where the defendant voluntarily absents himself and waives his right to confront the witnesses deposed in his absence.

        The trial court did not improperly consider in a motion to reduce sentence the defendant’s exercise of his right to stand trial or his corollary right to hold the state to its burden of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt through the presentation of testimony from the child victim, since the defendant forced the child to testify about the molestation in open court by exercising his right to stand trial and by presenting false testimony to the court in the hopes of escaping conviction and punishment, and had indicated his intention to appeal while knowing full well that what the little girl said from the stand was absolutely true.

        The trial court did not commit an abuse of discretion amounting to prejudicial error by limiting the defendant’s cross-examination of a police detective who received information from another officer.

        The defendant’s right to confrontation was improperly limited since the defense counsel was prohibited from questioning the sexual abuse victim about the allegations that she made against other men to the Department of Children, Youth and Families investigator, and therefore, the defense was denied the opportunity to cross-examine the victim.

        In a violation of probation hearing, there was no abuse of discretion when the court found that the defendant’s minor son was psychologically unavailable to testify for or against the defendant.

        Five factors that are considered in making a determination whether a restriction on cross-examination constitutes harmless error include: 1) the importance of a witness’ testimony in the prosecution’s case; 2) whether the testimony is cumulative; 3) the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of a witness on material points; 4) the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted; and 5) the overall strength of the prosecution’s case.

        The right to cross examination is not unlimited. Accordingly, since there was no evidence whatsoever that the witness had taken drugs on the day of the incident, or at any time thereabouts, such that the drug use would have affected the witness’ ability to observe and recall accurately the events of the day, there was no error in the trial court’s ruling precluding the introduction of the witness’ medical history referencing the drug use.

        There was no abuse of discretion in the trial justice declaring a witness unavailable where the testimony of a police officer, the issuance of a bench warrant for the witness after he had failed to appear at trial, and a search of the facilities where he may have been detained satisfied the requirement of reasonable good faith effort on the part of the prosecution.

        There was no error in the trial court’s limiting the scope of cross-examination of a victim where the defense sought to elicit testimony of her complaints of excessive discipline purportedly lodged against her father and her mother’s former boyfriend, since such complaints are fundamentally different from a complaint of sexual molestation and their admission would have served only to confuse and mislead the jury.

        Defendant was not deprived of his constitutional rights to confront and cross-examine the complaining witness by the exclusion of evidence of the prior sexual-abuse allegations the complaining witness purportedly made against her biological father when she was five years old. While both allegations were of sexual misconduct against father figures, the prior accusations defense counsel sought to introduce were different from the specific allegations against defendant of sexual penetration and the taking of nude photographs; and defense counsel had the opportunity to thoroughly attack the complaining witness’s credibility as defendant was afforded an opportunity to inquire into her purported motive to bring false accusations against defendant.

        In a prosecution for sexual abuse, the trial court did not err in refusing to grant the defendant broad access to the victim’s psychotherapy records on the alleged grounds that the victim has waived her psychotherapist-patient privilege by testifying about her discussions of the abuse with her doctor. The trial court’s

        The defendant’s right to cross-examine his accusers was violated since the trial court precluded the defendant from cross examining a witness, who placed him at the scene of a burglary, regarding any criminal activities she may have engaged in with her current boyfriend who was also charged with breaking and entering. The evidence was relevant and should have been admitted because it was evidence that tended to make the existence of a motive by the witness to testify more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.

        In determining whether an erroneous limitation on cross-examination is harmless, an appellate court considers: (1) the importance of the witness’s testimony to the prosecution’s case; (2) whether the testimony was cumulative; (3) the presence or absence of corroborating or contradictory evidence; (4) the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted; and (5) the overall strength of the prosecution’s case.

        In a prosecution for driving with a suspended license, a driver’s abstract from the Registry of Motor Vehicles was clearly admissible under Rules 901(b)(7) and 902(4) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, and was not excluded under Rule 803(8)(B) because it did not contain information observed by police officers or law-enforcement personnel. Also, the admission of this abstract did not violate the defendant’s right to confrontation under the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions by allowing, in effect, New York officials to testify about violations in that state. The report did not contain any statements by New York officials, only a notation of the New York violation. State v. D'Alo, 649 A.2d 498,

        Where defendant pleaded guilty believing and relying on his court-appointed counsel’s representations that a plea bargain had been agreed to by the state, when in fact no such bargain had been reached, defendant’s conviction was a product of ineffective assistance of counsel to such an extent as to render the proceedings a sham and deprive defendant of his right to counsel.

        In a murder investigation where police informed defendant’s lawyer that defendant was only wanted for questioning and was not a “suspect” and, after defendant’s arrest on another charge, failed to fully inform the lawyer of the investigation’s progress, the police conduct did not violate the defendant’s sixth amendment rights because there was no interference with his lawyer’s attempt to confer with his client.

        Defendant’s sixth amendment right to counsel was violated by the police in listening to telephone conversations between the defendant and a witness relating to the death of the victim where the witness asked questions of defendant and then pressed him for clarification of his equivocal responses, so that the role of the informant was not one of mere passive listener.

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to secure counsel of his choice was not violated by the denial of a motion for a continuance, because deferring the trial for 60 days and placing its start in the midst of a holiday season would have imposed significant inconvenience on the parties and thrown the children into an unduly stressful situation, the attorney already representing defendant was intimately familiar with the case and prepared for trial, and the trial court believed the motion to be a delaying tactic by defendant.

       <p>
        Cases in which per se conflicts of interest have been found typically involved situations where a lawyer failed to divulge a conflict implicating his own criminal conduct, and the situation where a third party with an arguable stake in the outcome of a case paid the lawyer did not necessarily result in an actual or constructive denial of the assistance of counsel. Familia-Consoro v. United States, 160 F.3d 761, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 29671 (1st Cir. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the unrebutted testimony was that the defendant’s brother, who paid the lawyer representing the defendant, never placed any restrictions on the representation to be provided, and where a defense that the brother, and not the defendant, was the guilty party, was presented, there was no showing that an improper economic motive resulted in ineffective assistance of counsel. Familia-Consoro v. United States, 160 F.3d 761, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 29671 (1st Cir. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was no evidence that, even had his lawyer called a witness to the stand, the man would have testified, and where the district court accepted the lawyer’s explanation that he did not subpoena the witness because he believed the witness would likely have asserted the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the court did not err in finding that a non-conflict motive informed trial counsel’s refusal to subpoena the witness. Familia-Consoro v. United States, 160 F.3d 761, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 29671 (1st Cir. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was subject to the cause and prejudice requirement on his federal ineffective assistance of counsel claim because he had created the “conflict” of interest about which he complained by choosing to retain a particular attorney as co-counsel despite knowing all the relevant facts, and by failing to apprise the court of that conflict. Schneider v. United States, 102 F. Supp. 2d 68, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9101 (D.R.I. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant failed to make a showing that his representation was adversely affected by a conflict of interest where his lead attorney had no such conflict, and where there was no evidence either of any influence exercised by co-counsel on the lead attorney or of knowledge on the part of the lead attorney of his co-counsel’s conflict.

        There is no per se conflict of interest when one public defender must argue the incompetence of another public defender from the same office which would result in the denial of a client’s right to counsel. Simpson v. State, 769 A.2d 1257,

        Defendant was not deprived of defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel based on an alleged conflict, where there was no indication in the record that defendant’s attorney labored under an actual conflict of interest due to counsel’s representation of defendant’s brother in connection with the same events.

        Inmate was not denied the effective assistance of trial counsel due to counsel’s prior representation of a prosecution witness because (1) the inmate affirmatively waived any error after the trial court explained the potential conflict, (2) nothing showed divided loyalties motivated counsel, and (3) counsel’s approach was based on sound strategy.

        Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel due to a conflict of interest when counsel simultaneously represented another individual in an unrelated criminal case whose child’s mother testified for the State in defendant’s case as the main eyewitness to the shooting, because (1) while counsel likely became aware that the witness was related to an individual facing criminal charges only through her representation of that individual, representing defendants with unrelated charges did not show divided loyalties, and (2) no effect on counsel’s representation of defendant was shown.

        Where defense counsel apprised the trial judge of a potential conflict of interest in representation of counsel’s client by filing a motion to withdraw prior to the impaneling of the jury, the failure of the trial judge to investigate this claim and the summary denial of defense counsel’s motion to withdraw violated the defendant’s sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.

        In determining whether a defendant has been denied his right to counsel, the standard to be used is that of reasonably effective assistance of counsel. State v. Cochrane, 443 A.2d 1249,
        <cite class="ri_code">

        Effective assistance of counsel means conscientious, meaningful representation wherein the accused is advised of his rights, and honest, learned and able counsel is given a reasonable opportunity to perform the task assigned to him. Angell v. State, 454 A.2d 709,

        If a defendant can show that certain evidence would not have been admitted but for counsel’s incompetence and that the evidence actually influenced the defendant’s decision to accept a guilty plea agreement, the defendant must be allowed to withdraw the plea because counsel’s incompetence rendered the plea an unknowing and unintelligent act. Dufresne v. Moran, 729 F.2d 18, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 24935 (1st Cir. 1984).

        The harmless-constitutional-error doctrine may be applied to deprivations of efficacious assistance, in cases where: (1) the violation does not run to a matter so basic as to trench inexorably, by its very nature, upon the elementary rights of the accused to a fair trial; (2) the infraction is not the result of conduct fairly attributable to the government (i.e., the prosecution or the court); and (3) the determination of the quantum and effect of disadvantagement can be made objectively, without “unguided speculation.” Sparfven v.

        A defendant is not prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to object with specificity to a first-degree murder jury instruction, even though a second-degree murder instruction is not warranted, where there is no reasonable probability on the evidence presented that the jury will find him guilty of second-degree murder.

        Counsel’s failure to raise and press the fourteenth amendment implications of a benzidine test did not constitute ineffective assistance because the trial was held before the use of benzidine was held to violate due process.

        In any case presenting a claim for the ineffective assistance of counsel, the inquiry regarding counsel’s performance must be whether counsel’s assistance was reasonable considering all of the circumstances. Crombe v. State, 607 A.2d 877,

        Counsel’s failure to produce firearms expert after stating in opening statement that one would be forthcoming did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel where he subsequently discovered that the expert was easily impeachable and counsel succeeded by dint of skillful cross-examination of the prosecution’s firearms expert, in eliciting much of the same opinion evidence that he hoped to establish through his own expert.

        The defendant failed to establish that the attorney was ineffective based upon the decision to call only one character witness out of a list of 25 individuals submitted by the defendant at trial. The decision to call only one witness was a wise tactical decision based upon the attorney’s extensive experience as a trial attorney and was made with the defendant’s tacit approval. Jacques v.

        Where a trial court rejected defense counsel’s argument that the defendant did not have the degree of control and authority over a drug dealing enterprise necessary to enhance his sentence, finding the fact that the defendant had negotiated a cocaine sale while in detention particularly significant, and where counsel’s failure to argue sentencing manipulation had no effect on the defendant’s offense level as a career offender, there was no ineffective assistance of counsel. Person v. United States, 27 F. Supp. 2d 317, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17951 (D.R.I. 1998).

        A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel failed where the decision not to call an expert witness was a strategic decision made after careful consideration. Powers v. State, 734 A.2d 508,

        It was not ineffective assistance of counsel where counsel decided not to retain an additional ballistic evidence expert, but to embark upon a different defense strategy by pointing the finger of guilt elsewhere, since the defendant was not thereby deprived of a trial that could be relied upon as having produced a just result.

        Defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not entertained by the appellate court where his appeal raised three non-record-based contentions, since a claim of incompetent counsel on direct appeal must be based on a sufficiently developed evidentiary record.

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed since his substantive argument that he was subjected to a de facto arrest without probable cause would not have succeeded, given the evidence and his failure to challenge the factual findings at trial, and since, even if the defendant had not consented to a search, the police officer would have been entitled to detain the defendant due to his evasive and inconsistent answers to questions and his nervous response. United States v. Cabrera, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 2501 (1st Cir. Feb. 18, 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 912, 121 S. Ct. 264, 148 L. Ed. 2d 192, 2000 U.S. LEXIS 6439 (2000).

        Defendant was entitled to a new trial since defense counsel’s representation was so wanting in all respects as to amount to a complete absence of a defense; the defense counsel neglected to move for a judgment of acquittal on the offense of burglary in spite of the fact that the record was devoid of any evidence that the defendant entered a dwelling with the specific intent to commit a felony therein, and she failed to request discovery from the prosecution, to submit a request to charge any lesser-included offenses, to present any defense based upon the defendant’s intoxication, and to file a motion for a new trial prior to the expiration of the appropriate limitation period.

        The defendant was not prejudiced by the failure of defense counsel to call the victim’s pediatrician as a witness since the prosecution introduced substantial evidence of the defendant’s guilt and equivocal testimony from the doctor would not have been enough to change the outcome of the case.

        Even if defense counsel’s failure to object to certain points during the trial had not reflected legitimate defense strategy, any error in raising those objections was harmless in light of the substantial other evidence inculpating the defendant. Toole v. State, 748 A.2d 806,

        Defendant’s failure to testify did not support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel where the hearing justice found as a fact, based on the conflicting evidence presented at the postconviction hearing, that the defendant was fully aware of his right to testify on his own behalf and that his decision not to testify was a voluntary one, made without any improper influence from counsel.

        Because defendant failed to provide transcripts or affidavits to support his pro se assertions of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel in his murder case, he failed to meet his burden of proof in a post-conviction relief proceeding. Bustamante v. Wall, 866 A.2d 516,

        With respect to defendant’s argument that his trial attorney failed to maintain his innocence by remarking that he “played a very minor role at most” in the crime and that he was “not as culpable as the other players in the case,” the court found that defendant failed to submit any transcript excerpts or citations supporting his argument. Without any evidence to support his allegations, the court was unable to determine exactly what trial counsel said, in what context the alleged statements were made, and whether the statements were against defendant’s wishes; consequently, he failed to sustain his burden of showing ineffective assistance of counsel. Bustamante v. Wall, 866 A.2d 516,

        Defendant’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel relating to his trial attorney’s failure to call character witnesses or to introduce an allegedly exculpatory biker jacket amounted to tactical decisions, and tactical decisions, even if ill-advised, do not by themselves constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.

        Defendant did not show that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and, thus, defendant was not entitled to relief on his postconviction application in case involving drug offenses that claimed that his Sixth Amendment rights had been violated. Trial counsel’s decision not to call a man who executed an affidavit that purportedly exculpated defendant, or at least present the man’s prior testimony, appeared to be a sound tactical decision given the man’s poor credibility and prior criminal history.

        Because at the time of the appeal from the judgment of conviction it was reasonable for defendant’s counsel to conclude that the trial justice’s decision to close the courtroom for a child witness’ testimony was not a strong issue for appeal, and since defendant’s counsel made a considered tactical decision not to object to the amended indictment, there was no ineffective counsel requiring postconviction relief.

    Strickland v. Washington,

        There was nothing in the record that allowed a court to conclude that counsel’s failure to compel production of a pastor’s notes prejudiced a postconviction relief applicant in any way; the notes never were produced, even at the postconviction-relief proceeding, and the hearing justice’s supposition that the notes may have been critical material was insufficient to demonstrate the necessary prejudice to the applicant that was needed to meet
    Strickland’s
    second prong. The hearing justice erred when she speculated about the importance and assumed impact of the pastor’s notes. Brown v. State, 964 A.2d 516,

        Given that a court on direct appeal found a claim that a pastor bolstered the victim’s testimony to be without merit, counsel’s failure to specify that his objection was based on impermissible bolstering was not ineffective assistance because no prejudice could have resulted from such an omission. Because the determination that a pastor’s testimony was permissible was based on the content of her testimony and not on who she was, her appearance on the local television news would have had no impact on the decision on direct appeal.

        Applicant for postconviction relief failed to meet his burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that his application should have been granted; he never presented any evidence concerning his counsel’s failure to object to a pastor’s testimony as to the pastor’s status as an expert witness—the pastor had testified as to his counseling sessions with the applicant and that the pastor had dealt with a lot of sex offenders. Furthermore, even if the applicant had presented some evidence on this issue and as a result that court were to have concluded that counsel was deficient in this regard, there was no evidence that the applicant was prejudiced by this deficiency because there was other compelling evidence of the applicant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

        Even if a reviewing court agreed with a postconviction hearing justice’s declaration that it was unthinkable to elicit testimony from an applicant’s daughter that she did not believe that the victim told her that the applicant molested the victim and that the daughter did not believe the victim, such a decision did not justify a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. The claim lacked merit because eliciting the testimony was trial strategy; counsel attempted to cast doubt on the victim’s credibility by offering the daughter’s testimony. Brown v.

        Trial court properly denied defendant’s post-conviction petition as defendant had failed to overcome the strong presumption that his counsel’s performance was reasonably professional, in that counsel testified that he first learned of the traffic stop, which would provide an alibi for defendant in his murder case, just before trial, two years into his representation of defendant, and that, because no detail surrounding the stop were provided and because defendant had waited so long to provide him with this information, counsel refrained from pursuing an investigation and from seeking a continuance. The ever-shifting nature of defendant’s story served to confirm the hearing justice’s conclusion that the information about the traffic stop was withheld and disclosed only when defendant thought he could safely do so and discredited the testimony of defendant and his wife that they discussed the stop with the attorney in the early stages of his representation.

        Defense counsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to adequately investigate a petitioner’s case, failing to obtain and review discovery documents, and failing to view a videotape of the drug deal as: (1) counsel was sufficiently familiar with the case and was cognizant of the credibility of the state’s witnesses; (2) the petitioner desired that this ordeal conclude quickly, and the plea bargain struck by counsel made the petitioner eligible for parole quickly; (3) counsel was aware of the strength of the state’s evidence and the undercover police officer’s reputation for integrity; (4) the petitioner’s arrest was just one of many arrests stemming from a large undercover operation that was handled by counsel’s office; and (5) the petitioner did not point to anything but a lost videotape that was not provided to counsel.

        While trial counsel’s conduct in disclosing the inmate’s psychiatric records to the prosecutor fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, trial counsel’s deficient performance was not so deficient as to have prejudiced the inmate and deprived him of a fair trial. Even if the challenged testimony had been excluded, there was an abundance of other compelling evidence, including the testimony of the victim, of the inmate’s guilt that was sufficient for the jury to convict him beyond a reasonable doubt.

        Farce-and-mockery standard for ineffective assistance of counsel claims has no place in assessing such claims after Strickland because (1) the standard has been rejected in favor of a standard requiring reasonably competent or effective assistance, (2) nothing in Strickland purports to revive the standard, and (3) the standard is rooted in the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. V, while claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are grounded in the guarantee of the assistance of counsel contained in U.S. Const. amend. VI and

        A criminal defendant has the right to be present at all stages of his trial when his absence may affect the fairness of the proceedings against him. State v. Holland, 430 A.2d 1263,

        Where the trial justice found that the government in good faith did not learn of defendant’s confession until the eve of trial, defense counsel was promptly informed of the admission and the government’s intent to introduce it at trial, and the trial justice offered defendant an opportunity for a recess following the close of direct testimony eliciting the confession if he needed more time to prepare adequately before commencing cross-examination, it was clear that the trial justice adequately protected defendant’s due-process rights, right to effective assistance of counsel and right to a fair trial by affording him opportunities to request more time throughout the trial.

        In shoplifting trial, failure to preserve as evidence the items concealed by defendant and later recovered by the store detective did not deprive defendant of a fair trial since there was no evidence that the state acted in bad faith or was negligent with regard to the loss of the evidence; the items themselves were not difficult for the jury to visualize; and the state’s untainted proof, the eyewitness testimony of the store detective, was strong independent evidence of defendant’s guilt.

        Where the defendant was charged with manslaughter for allegedly stabbing her husband during an argument, the prosecutor’s question to the defendant regarding an unsubstantiated allegation that the defendant had stabbed her former husband was inherently prejudicial to her right to a fair and impartial trial and its destructive impact was not cured by the cautionary instructions given to the jury by the trial justice.

        A newspaper’s qualified right of access to an FBI agent’s affidavit that was submitted in support of a request for a warrant to search the Providence City Hall was outweighed by the likelihood that dissemination of the affidavit’s contents prior to trial would prejudice the defendants’ right to a fair trial where (1) the affidavit was unusually prejudicial as it contained many statements that appeared to have little bearing on whether probable cause existed to search the locations in question, (2) it contained more statements attributed to third parties and anonymous sources than are found in a typical search warrant affidavit, as well as an inordinate number of what were nothing more than the affiant’s conclusions and opinions, (3) it was written in a uniquely inflammatory style, with a storybook format that was liberally interspersed with evocative headings and characterizations, and (4) it contained derogatory statements about individuals who had not been charged that were unsubstantiated.

        without submitting that question to the jury to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Recidivism was quite common and the fact of prior convictions was easily determined by resort to the public record, which meant that the fact of a prior conviction did not have to be submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt to obtain habitual offender sentencing.

        As defendant failed to make out a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination by the prosecutor’s use of a peremptory challenge to remove the only Asian prospective juror, defendant’s claim that his equal protection rights were violated lacked merit; the trial court conducted a
    Batson

        Defendant’s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury was not violated as the trial justice did not err in denying defendant’s motion to pass the case because the prosecutor’s question to defendant regarding the possession of photographs of naked individuals was not sufficiently related to charges of assault by strangulation and simple assault; the possession of the photographs was not criminal; and the prosecutor’s question was not so inflammatory that the trial justice was unable to expiate the harm. The trial justice correctly sustained defendant’s objection and gave a cautionary instruction to the jury that cured the prejudice created by the prosecutor’s improper comments; and the jurors nodded in response that they could disregard the question.

        It is not error for the trial justice to allow the prosecutor to use a peremptory challenge to dismiss a black juror without requiring a racially neutral, non-discriminatory explanation for the challenge, where the juror challenged is black, not a member of the defendant’s race, and the defendant shows no pattern of discrimination or other circumstances during voir dire that support a finding of a discriminatory motive on the part of the prosecutor. State v. Kelly, 554 A.2d 632,

       <p>
        The fact that the excluded juror knew the defense attorney prior to the trial as counsel to a friend is a sufficiently neutral reason for excluding him. Even if we assume that defendant set out a prima facie case of racial discrimination, the court believes that the state met its burden of proof by advancing a neutral reason for exercising the peremptory challenge against the excluded juror.

        Trial court did not err in refusing defendant’s request for a hearing on whether the jury selection process resulted in a systematic and deliberate exclusion of men. There was no evidence in the record showing that the jury was not a fair cross-section of the community, nor was there any reason for the trial court to think otherwise; thus, defendant had not established a prima facie case of a Sixth Amendment violation.

        Though the indictment charging the defendant with sexual assault was inartfully drawn in that it did not refer directly to the subsection of the section under which he was being charged, the count was otherwise sufficient because the defendant, having been put on notice that he was being charged with first-degree sexual assault, suffered no prejudice; furthermore, the bill of particulars for which defendant moved with respect to other charges was sufficient to provide him with the specific circumstance of force or coercion underlying the first charge.

        A trial justice may properly order the public from the courtroom if, in light of the nature of the crime, the expected testimony, or the emotional state of the witness, he has determined that the testimony would likely be severely hampered or distorted if the witness were required to testify in public.

        A trial justice has the discretion to exclude spectators from the courtroom in certain circumstances, including when necessary to protect a witness from the embarrassment or emotional pressures that often result when a victim must relate the details of a lurid crime in open court.

        is compatible with constitutional free press guarantees because the press enjoys no greater right of access to juvenile proceedings than does the general public. Excluding the press from the category of those “with a direct interest” in these proceedings is, therefore, clearly permissible. Edward A. Sherman Publishing Co. v. Goldberg, 443 A.2d 1252,

        The defendant’s right to a public trial was violated by the trial judge’s exclusion of spectators from the courtroom during the testimony of the complaining witness without first holding an evidentiary hearing. Santos v. Brown, 596 F. Supp. 214, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22945 (D.R.I. 1984), limited, Chalk v. Rhode Island, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125023 (D.R.I.

        A protective order prohibiting the press access to materials obtained by discovery under Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. Rule 16 must: (1) be narrowly tailored to serve the interests sought to be protected, (2) be the only reasonable alternative, (3) permit access to those parts of the record not deemed sensitive, and (4) be accompanied by the trial justice’s specific findings explaining the necessity for the order.

        Where the trial court’s only reason for denying the press access to materials discovered pursuant to Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. Rule 16 was that disclosure “could create a substantial probability that defendant would not get a fair trial,” the trial court’s blanket statement of a potential prejudice was insufficient to demonstrate compelling reasons for ordering the sealing of the discovery documents.

        The right to a public trial is not absolute; in some circumstances, it may be overridden by other rights or interests. One such interest is safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor witness. Fayerweather v. Moran, 749 F. Supp. 43, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14652 (D.R.I. 1990).

        The trial court has an obligation to permit access to those parts of the record not deemed sensitive when a closure is ordered.

       <p>
        When limited closure is ordered, the constitutional values sought to be protected by holding open proceedings may be satisfied later by making a transcript of the closed proceedings available within a reasonable time, if the judge determines that disclosure can be accomplished while safeguarding the juror’s valid privacy interests. Even then a valid privacy right may rise to a level that part of the transcript should be sealed, or the name of a juror withheld, to protect the person from embarrassment. Providence Journal Co. v.

        reflects the Legislature’s effort to establish procedures for the protection of child victims, it does not anticipate that a trial justice summarily will exclude the public from attending a trial. After all, it is the defendant who is accused and whose right to a public trial is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.State v. Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d 984,

        Trial justice did not deprive defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial by closing the courtroom while child witness testified since defendant failed to articulate a legal basis for his objection. Furthermore, and fatal to defendant’s Sixth Amendment challenge, there was no showing that anyone, whether court personnel or the citizenry, was, in fact, excluded from that portion of the trial. State v. Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d 984,

        Trial justice’s limited ruling to close a courtroom to “unnecessary personnel,” standing alone, did not establish that the public was excluded.

        Although there was a delay of four years between defendant’s indictment and trial, where the state made no deliberate attempt to delay the trial, defendant also having contributed to the delay, and defendant failed to prove she was prejudiced, and lastly where defendant did not make a strong effort to assert her right to a speedy trial, this right was not violated.

        Extradition proceedings are not criminal prosecutions within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment, so that the right to a speedy trial did not attach in that situation. Sabatier v. Dabrowski, 586 F.2d 866, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 7702 (1st Cir. 1978).

        The guarantee of a speedy trial is inapplicable to international extradition proceedings, which are not criminal in nature, but sui generis. Sabatier v. Dambrowski, 453 F. Supp. 1250, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16753 (D.R.I.), aff'd, 586 F.2d 866, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 7702 (1st Cir. 1978).

        The “arrest” or “accusatory stage” constitutes the starting point for determining whether a defendant has been denied the right to a speedy trial. State v. Roddy, 401 A.2d 23,

        In determining whether a defendant’s speedy-trial right has been violated, the Supreme Court will apply the four-pronged test of Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972). Thus, it will consider and balance: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) whether the defendants asserted their right to a speedy trial; and (4) whether the defendants have been prejudiced by the delay. State v. Roddy, 401 A.2d 23,

        The balancing test suggested in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972) needs to be invoked only when the length of delay in the peculiar circumstances of the case warrants inquiry into the other factors cited. State v. Roddy, 401 A.2d 23,

        Prejudice suffered by a defendant as a result of the delay may take the form of specific harm to the presentment of a defense or simply the form of personal prejudice such as the loss of employment and family or the experience of public scorn occasioned by having to stand accused for a significant period of time. State v. Roddy, 401 A.2d 23,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1979 R.I. LEXIS 1807

       <p>
        Although there was a 34-month delay between arrest and commencement of trial, there was no evidence of bad faith by the state; both the state and defendants shared responsibility for the delay; and, while defendants had made a demand for a speedy trial, they were not prejudiced by the delay. Therefore, defendants were not denied their right to a speedy trial. State v. Roddy, 401 A.2d 23,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1979 R.I. LEXIS 1807

        The speedy trial right was designed to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and to limit the possibility that the defense would be hampered. State v. Fortier, 427 A.2d 1317,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1096

        Although the gravamen of the right to a speedy trial is to protect the accused, there are other societal interests that are safeguarded by the constitutional requirement of a speedy trial. State v. Fortier, 427 A.2d 1317,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1096

        A valid reason, such as a missing witness, should serve to justify an appropriate delay. State v. Fortier, 427 A.2d 1317,

        A court should not allow defendants to count, for purposes of determining the length of delay, periods of time in which defendants fail to timely comply with the state’s request for discovery and thereby profit from their own dilatory tactics. State v. Fortier, 427 A.2d 1317,
        <cite class="ri_code">

        Right to a speedy trial was not denied where the record strongly indicated that the defendant did not want a speedy trial and that the filing of the motion was merely a perfunctory gesture since the defendant preferred to bank on the lapse of time, hoping that witnesses would disappear or memories would become dim. State v. DeVito, 414 A.2d 459,
        <cite class="ri_code">

        The test for determining whether an accused has been denied his right to a speedy trial is set forth in
        Barker v. Wingo, 1972 U.S. LEXIS 34, 407 U.S. 514, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972). State v. Allan, 433 A.2d 222,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1242
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether an accused has been denied his right to a speedy trial, the courts consider four factors: (1) the length of the delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) the defendant’s assertion of his rights and (4) the prejudice to the accused. Yet, no one of these factors alone is either a necessary or a sufficient condition to establish a deprivation. Rather, they are all related factors and must be considered together with such other circumstances as are relevant. State v. Allan, 433 A.2d 222,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1242
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the delay between a defendant’s arrest and commencement of his trial is long enough to be considered “presumptively prejudicial,” the remaining three criteria (the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, and the assertion of the right by the defendant) announced in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972), for determining whether there has been a violation of the right to a speedy trial will be examined. State v. Charette, 434 A.2d 280,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1260
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prejudice to the defendant from a delay between his arrest and commencement of his trial may take the form of pretrial incarceration, anxiety and mental strain, or impairment of the defense of the case. State v. Charette, 434 A.2d 280,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1260
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant’s failure to demand a speedy trial is relevant in deciding whether he has been prejudiced by delay between arrest and commencement of trial. State v. Charette, 434 A.2d 280,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1260

        (R.I. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Delay in the commencement of defendant’s trial due in part to a technical flaw in his original indictment was not a deliberate attempt by the state to prejudice defendant. State v. Charette, 434 A.2d 280,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1260

        (R.I. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Period of two and one-half years between arrest and commencement of the trial was at least “presumptively prejudicial.” State v. Charette, 434 A.2d 280,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1260
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant first filed a speedy trial motion 12 days after arraignment and did not renew it until he called the case ready for trial almost 33 months later, defendant was less than aggressive in asserting his right to a speedy trial and this was factor weighing against defendant’s claim that he had been denied a speedy trial. State v. Allan, 433 A.2d 222,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1242

       <p>
        Where not only did defendant fail to demand a speedy trial but he also contributed to the delay and no serious prejudice to defendant resulted in a delay of two and one-half years between arrest and trial did not deny defendant of his right to a speedy trial. State v. Charette, 434 A.2d 280,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1981 R.I. LEXIS 1260

        Thirty-two-month delay between accusation of commission of crime and commencement of trial was presumptively prejudicial. State v. Anthony, 448 A.2d 744,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1982 R.I. LEXIS 963
        </cite>

       </p>
       <p>
        Failure of defendant to assert right to a speedy trial until nearly two years after return of indictment was a factor to be weighed against him in his assertion of the right. State v. Anthony, 448 A.2d 744,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1982 R.I. LEXIS 963

        (R.I. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where proceedings were delayed as result of defense counsel’s participation in another trial, and where it was unlikely that either defendant or counsel could have anticipated at time counsel was retained that other trial would go forward well in advance of defendant’s trial, delay could not be attributed to defendant. State v. Anthony, 448 A.2d 744,
        <cite class="ri_code">

        In determining cause for delay in commencement of trial, delay caused by neutral factors such as crowded dockets is weighed less heavily than delay for tactical purposes. State v. Anthony, 448 A.2d 744,

        Although felony trials should take place within six months of the indictment, such a policy should not be construed as indicating that a failure to meet that goal in a particular case amounts to a denial of the right to a speedy trial guaranteed by
        <cite class="ri_code">
         R.I. Const., Art. I, § 10
        </cite>

         R.I. Const., Art. 1, Sec. 10

       </p>
       <p>
        Twenty-one month delay from time of arraignment to the time of trial did not violate defendant’s right to a speedy trial, since the state was not solely responsible for the delay, the delay attributable to the state was not tactically motivated, defendant did not actively pursue his right to a speedy trial, and, although defendant was incarcerated for the entire period from his arrest until trial thereby heightening anxiety and mental strain, he was awaiting trial for a most vicious and brutal murder and there was no evidence to support a finding that his ability to conduct his defense was impaired by the incarceration or the passage of time. State v. Adams, 481 A.2d 718,
        <cite class="ri_code">
         1984 R.I. LEXIS 601

       <p>
        The defendants’ assertion that they had suffered emotional trauma from awaiting trial for over a year was an insufficient basis for a claim of denial of a speedy trial. State v. Long, 488 A.2d 427,

        The mere allegation of an unavailable witness is too speculative and clearly insufficient to tip the scales in favor of a defendant in a speedy trial inquiry. State v. McMaugh, 512 A.2d 824,

        Defendant was not denied her right to a speedy trial where a portion of the delay was caused by the granting of her motion for continuance because her attorney was on trial in another jurisdiction. State v. McMaugh, 512 A.2d 824,
        <cite class="ri_code">

       <p>
        Where defendants were neither incarcerated nor under indictment nor subject to bail during the period between the dismissal of one indictment and the issuance of a subsequent indictment, that interval could not be used to determine if there was a violation of the constitutional guarantee of a speedy trial.

        Delay caused by the criminal-court-calendar system that allows a case continued or not reached to go back into the scheduling computer for several months before being placed on the calendar again is usually accorded less weight than is delay deliberately caused by the state in order to gain a tactical advantage over a defendant; however, the ultimate responsibility for such delay must be borne by the government.

        Where defendant was arrested on May 28, 1982, arraigned on July 7, 1982, and trial on the indictment began on August 28, 1985, the length of delay was “presumptively prejudicial”. State v. Wheaton, 528 A.2d 1109,

        Six-year delay between defendant’s arraignment and his trial for arson did not violate his right to a speedy trial, where defendant conducted discovery and sought nine separate continuances in the first two years after his arraignment and his counsel later made five additional motions to continue the proceedings.

        A defendant’s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial is to be assessed according to the four-part test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972). The elements of the four-part test include (1) length of the delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) the defendant’s assertion of the right, and (4) the prejudice to the defendant. State v. Perez, 605 A.2d 1305,

       <p>
        Although nearly 18 months elapsed from the date of a defendant’s arrest until the start of his trial, and such a delay was sufficient to be presumptively prejudicial, the lack of any prejudice to the defendant as a result of the delay weighed against his claim that the state violated his speedy-trial right. State v. Austin, 643 A.2d 798,

        The defendant’s state and federal constitutional rights to a speedy trial were violated, requiring vacating of his conviction for possession-of-a-firearm charge that was brought to trial almost 11 years after the defendant’s indictment. State v. Powers, 643 A.2d 827,

        The defendant was deprived of his right to a speedy trial when the delay lasted five years and was primarily attributable to the negligence of the state. State v. DeAngelis, 658 A.2d 7,

        Although more than five years passed between the defendant’s indictment and the trial, most of that delay was attributable to the defendant’s voluntary and unlawful absence from the state. Accordingly, the trial court found, with no objection from the defendant, that the new speedy trial clock began to run when the defendant was returned to this state. Based on this finding, the length of delay was less than twelve months and, therefore, not presumptively prejudicial, eliminating the requirement to consider the remaining three

        The defendant’s single request to counsel for a speedy trial following the defendant’s extended unlawful absence from the state is clearly insufficient to qualify as an assertion of the right to a speedy trial. State v. Bleau, 668 A.2d 642,

        Where the primary reason for a one and a half year delay between the defendant’s arrest and the start of his trial was court congestion, but some of the delay was due to the fact that the defendant was tried during that time for two other cases that occurred within the same time-frame, and some was due to minor delays attributable to the defendant, the bulk of the delay being attributable to the state was weighted less heavily in a determination of the defendant’s right to a speedy trial because the delay was the product of crowded calendars and not deliberate conduct.

        Where, over the course of a year and a half, defendant never requested a speedy trial, but waited until ten months after his arrest to move to dismiss the charges, renewing this motion five months later, defendant’s efforts fell short of evidencing a real desire to invoke his constitutional rights and proceed to trial.

        Defendant was not denied a speedy trial since, although the state moved for and obtained several continuances, it was not primarily responsible for causing the long delays, most of which were attributable to the defendant’s churning through the seven attorneys who represented him.

        A defendant was more culpable than the state for causing a delay in his trial since he knew of his indictment, his initial court date, and the warrant for his arrest, yet still left the jurisdiction for 16 years, which was not merely negligent but willful and deliberate.

        Where a defendant intentionally avoided returning to the jurisdiction to face charges that he knew or should have known were still pending against him, and was thus himself largely responsible for the delay in his eventual trial, any presumptive prejudice he may have suffered was insufficient by itself to support a finding that the state violated his right to a speedy trial.

        Trial court did not err by failing to recognize defendant’s remarks at the commencement of his trial as a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial as no such motion was articulated for the trial justice to have made a ruling on, and defendant’s counsel made no such motion. As a result, defendant’s issue on appeal that the trial court erred by denying his pro se motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial was deemed unpreserved for appellate review. State v.

        Defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to dismiss an indictment on speedy trial grounds; as much of the 14-year delay between the applicant’s arrest and his extradition to Rhode Island was attributable to his flight from the state and his attempts to fight extradition, such a motion would have been denied.

        Defendant was not prejudiced by a delay of 67 months between the reversal of his first conviction and his retrial, where defendant acquiesced in the delay attributable to a codefendant, obtained another delay owing to his fear of improper publicity, and did not generally show an aggressive assertion of his right to a speedy trial.

        Defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated, even though the 45-month delay between the vacation of the conviction from defendant’s first trial and the commencement of his retrial was presumptively prejudicial, where the primary reasons for the delay were defendant’s first attorney’s unpreparedness for trial and his second attorney’s reasonable trial preparation efforts. In addition, both attorneys failed to assert defendant’s speedy trial rights, defendant acquiesced in the first 17 months of the delay, and he failed to show prejudice. State v.

        The determination of whether statements made during custodial interrogation are admissible against the accused is to be made upon an inquiry into the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation in order to ascertain whether the accused in fact knowingly and voluntarily decided to waive his rights to remain silent and to have the assistance of counsel.

        Where despite being informed of his rights on several occasions, the defendant repeatedly stated that he did not want an attorney and then voluntarily wrote out a statement without any police prompting, the fact that he also wrote “yes” on a waiver-of-rights form asking whether he wanted an attorney did not render his statement inadmissible.

        Usually, in the absence of coersive pressures, a court will find a waiver of an accused’s right to counsel and privilege against self-incrimination if the defendant was informed of his rights, as required by Miranda, indicated that he understood them, and then voluntarily made a statement.

        Trial court erred by requiring a defendant to choose between defending himself pro se or proceeding to trial with an attorney who refused to implement the defendant’s personal right to waive a jury trial because the right to waive a jury trial was defendant’s right, not counsel’s right, and, therefore, defendant did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his U.S. Const. amend.

        Trial court did not err in finding that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel because (1) defendant was told of the seriousness of the situation, (2) defendant’s alleged lack of understanding that he would have to proceed pro se if he did not hire counsel did not show a constitutionally inadequate waiver, (3) the appellate court deferred to the trial justice’s finding that defendant intentionally manipulated the proceedings, (4) defendant’s mental competency was not at issue, (5) defendant’s technical legal knowledge did not have to be assessed, and (6) defendant was clearly warned of the dangers of proceeding pro se.

        Defendant waived his argument that his right to confrontation regarding one witness was violated because defendant did not raise a Confrontation Clause argument at trial but instead merely argued that the witness’s statements to police were probative and therefore admissible under the Rules of Evidence.

        Defendant waived her argument that the trial judge violated her Confrontation Clause rights by preventing her cross-examination of a witness regarding the promises, rewards, and inducements detectives offered the witness because at no point did defendant raise such an argument relating to the questioning; defendant raised no basis for the admission and wholly failed to press the issue, and the record did not support her contention that the testimony she was trying to bring out was obvious.

        In the absence of explicit congressional guidance, a court should consider the following factors to determine if a given case or issue implicates seventh amendment concerns: (i) customs prevailing before the merger of law and equity; (ii) the nature of the remedy sought; and (iii) the practical abilities and limitations of juries. Deborah Leslie, Ltd. v. Rona, Inc., 630 F. Supp. 1250, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27694 (D.R.I. 1986).

        This amendment is not a limitation on state power to determine when jury trials will be afforded in civil cases.

        The last clause of this amendment is not restricted in its application to suits at common law tried before juries in federal court, but applies equally to a case tried by jury in a state court and brought to the supreme court by writ of error.

        Although the State Fair Employment Practices Act provides for a jury trial in Rhode Island Superior Court, federal law, rather than state law, governs the right to a jury trial on a state-created claim tried in federal court.

        Plaintiff is not entitled to a jury trial under either Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act or under the State Fair Employment Practices Act, where her request for back pay supplements constitutes a request for purely equitable relief.

        Although under the state Fair Employment Practices Act, both parties were afforded the right to request a jury trial in Rhode Island Superior Court, federal rather than state law governed the right to a jury trial on a state-created claim tried in federal court, and since Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. did not afford a jury trial in cases where purely equitable relief is being sought, the plaintiff ’s demand for trial by jury was denied. Noviello v. Rhode Island Dep't of Mental Health Retardation &amp; Hosp., 142 F.R.D. 581, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5081 (D.R.I. 1991).

        The issues involved and the remedy sought in a contribution action pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), 42 U.S.C. § 9607, are equitable in nature, and no right to a jury trial attaches under this amendment. American Cyanamid Co. v. King Indus., Inc., 814 F. Supp. 209, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1699 (D.R.I. 1993).

        A determination of the legislature and courts of a state that solitary confinement in the penitentiary until execution of a death sentence is not cruel and unusual punishment is conclusive upon federal court.

        The length of confinement cannot be ignored in deciding whether the confinement meets constitutional standards since a filthy, overcrowded cell and a diet of “gruel,” while tolerable for a few days, would be intolerably cruel for weeks or months. La Plante v. Southworth, 484 F. Supp. 115, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9904 (D.R.I. 1980).

        The proportionality of sentence analysis under the Eighth Amendment should be guided by objective criteria, including (i) the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty; (ii) the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction; and (iii) the sentences imposed for the commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.

        Criminal forfeiture is a form of punishment and, therefore, subject to the eighth amendment’s prohibition against disproportionate punishments. United States v. Robinson, 721 F. Supp. 1541, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11510 (D.R.I. 1989).
       </p>

        The penalty of forfeiture of a defendant’s apartment lease and concomitant federal housing assistance benefits is disproportionately severe in light of the defendant’s conduct of knowingly and intentionally distributing a mixture containing cocaine-base.

        The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against excessive punishment does not extend to allegedly disproportionate sanctions imposed in the course of civil forfeiture proceedings. United States v. One Parcel of Real Property with Bldgs., 960 F.2d 200, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 4419 (1st Cir. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The imposing of an additional 25 years pursuant to the habitual-criminal statute, after the imposition of two life sentences without eligibility for parole, was not cruel and unusual punishment, where the defendant had two prior convictions for rape of a child under the age of 16 in Massachusetts for which he received prison sentences, and where he was found guilty and convicted of the murders and torture of two children with a screwdriver in Rhode Island. State v. Smith, 602 A.2d 931,

        Supreme Court of Rhode Island adopted the narrow application of proportionality announced by the United States Supreme Court in the Ewing decision, and applied it to claims under both the federal and Rhode Island constitutions by a post-conviction relief petitioner who challenged a sentence to which petitioner had agreed; since the sentence was neither illegal nor grossly disproportionate to petitioner’s offenses, the agreement was enforced.

       <p>
        Inmate’s criminal contempt sentence of 25 years, with ten years to serve and 15 years suspended, did not violate the Eighth Amendment because (1) the inmate repeatedly refused to obey orders seeking the inmate’s rehabilitation through participation in treatment, which was of highest priority, given the unusually brutal nature of the murders the inmate committed, and (2) the inmate’s refusal presented a grave public danger and a criminal offense against the court’s dignity.

        Where a defendant was represented by counsel of his choice, assisted his counsel in the design of a plea agreement that prevented him from felony charges and, after thorough questioning by the hearing justice, had the opportunity to “sleep on” his decision to enter into the agreement, he could not claim his rights were violated by that agreement.

         Prison Conditions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Prison officials have a duty under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners. Leonardo v. Moran, 611 F.2d 397, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 9505 (1st Cir. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Deliberate indifference to violent attacks, sexual assaults and serious medical needs is actionable. Leonardo v. Moran, 611 F.2d 397, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 9505 (1st Cir. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claim alleging serious medical needs and deliberate indifference on the part of prison officials toward those needs is cognizable as cruel and unusual punishment proscribed by this amendment. Ferranti v. Moran, 618 F.2d 888, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 18490 (1st Cir. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The malicious use of force on an inmate by a correctional officer violates the guarantees of the Eighth Amendment. La Plante v. Southworth, 484 F. Supp. 115, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9904 (D.R.I. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the maximum security section was clearly unfit for human habitation according to any criteria used by public health officers or professional corrections personnel, and psychiatric and psychological evaluations and treatment were inadequate to meet the needs of the inmate population, this intolerable totality of conditions violated inmates’ Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. La Plante v. Southworth, 484 F. Supp. 115, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9904 (D.R.I. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inadequate medical care to prisoners does not reach the level of a constitutional violation because of inadvertent or negligent errors in diagnosis or treatment; rather, the test of constitutional violation, which amounts to a recklessness standard, requires a showing of conscious disregard by the defendants of a substantial risk that serious injury or illness would be engendered or prolonged by the inadequacies of the medical system. La Plante v. Southworth, 484 F. Supp. 115, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9904 (D.R.I. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendants did not act in disregard of the plaintiff’s constitutional rights by placing and keeping him in a behavioral control unit for 120 days since it could be said the prison officials displayed a “deliberate indifference” to the plaintiff’s illness. La Plante v. Southworth, 484 F. Supp. 115, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9904 (D.R.I. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of a class action challenging the entire system of prison medical care delivery as a condition of cruel and inhuman punishment, deliberate indifference can be shown either by a series of incidents closely related in time or by evidence that the medical facilities are so wholly inadequate for the prison population’s needs that suffering would be inevitable. La Plante v. Southworth, 484 F. Supp. 115, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9904 (D.R.I. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Details of duration and condition may be determinative of an eighth amendment claim, for 23 hours’ daily confinement in a cell permitting communication among inmates may well be constitutional, even over extended periods, while 23 hours per day in a closed cell for a shorter period might not be permissible. Morris v. Travisono, 707 F.2d 28, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 27384 (1st Cir. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        None of inmate’s allegations of harm or deprivation constituted constitutional violations. See Chase v. Quick, 596 F. Supp. 33, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16780 (D.R.I. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since all policies, practices and administrative procedures are set by and are under the control of the director of the department of corrections, and since he has set no policies to safeguard inmates against unconstitutional conduct on the part of his subordinates, he must be held responsible for the unconstitutional conduct of his subordinates. Ferola v. Moran, 622 F. Supp. 814, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13621 (D.R.I. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prison officials’ failure to have a nurse change an inmate’s bandages three times a day, even if coupled with some curtailment of shower access, could not be equated with deliberate indifference to his medical needs, where the prison staff did not ignore the inmate’s medical condition, deprive him of needed care in any constitutionally significant sense, or display an intention of punishing him by withholding treatment. DesRosiers v. Moran, 949 F.2d 15, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 26958 (1st Cir. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        A prison inmate’s complaint that a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment. Fenner v. Moran, 772 F. Supp. 59, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21943 (D.R.I. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        A prisoner’s claim that his medium security status resigned him to a vegetative state did not amount to an eighth amendment violation. Cugini v. Ventetuolo, 781 F. Supp. 107, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16 (D.R.I. 1992), aff'd, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 29867 (1st Cir. June 26, 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A doctor’s diagnosis reflected deliberate indifference to an inmate’s needs sufficient to raise a factual question of an Eighth Amendment violation in light of the non-availability of qualified immunity under the circumstances. Rosen v. Chang, 811 F. Supp. 754, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 750 (D.R.I. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        A claim of inadequate medical treatment which reflects no more than a disagreement with prison officials about what constitutes appropriate medical care does not state a cognizable claim under the eighth amendment. Figueroa v. Vose, 874 F. Supp. 500, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19599 (D.R.I. 1994), aff'd, 66 F.3d 306, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 31634 (1st Cir. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment was inappropriate where a reasonable jury could find that the director of the state corrections agency disregarded an excessive risk to inmates’ health and safety by not transferring or suspending a corrections officer prior to the date when he allegedly assaulted the plaintiff, since the plaintiff could demonstrate that the director was aware of altercations between the officer and inmates. Pona v. Vose, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3760 (D.R.I. Jan. 4, 2000).
       </p>

       <p>
        This amendment refers only to suits and actions by individuals against the state. Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 657, 9 L. Ed. 1233, 1838 U.S. LEXIS 372 (1838).
       </p>
       <p>
        An award of attorney’s fees against state officials under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 is not barred by this amendment. Lund v. Affleck, 442 F. Supp. 1109, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12451 (D.R.I. 1977), aff'd, 587 F.2d 75, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 7521 (1st Cir. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        This amendment bars not only suits where the state is a named defendant, but also suits in which the state, although not named, is the real party in interest. Rhode Island Affiliate, American Civil Liberties Union, Inc. v. Rhode Island Lottery Comm'n, 553 F. Supp. 752, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16453 (D.R.I. 1982); Vanlaarhoven v. Newman, 564 F. Supp. 145, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17586 (D.R.I. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The question in each case is whether the relief constitutes permissible prospective redress ancillary to an equitable remedy, not barred by this amendment, or a retroactive award requiring the state to pay funds from the public fisc. Vanlaarhoven v. Newman, 564 F. Supp. 145, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17586 (D.R.I. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of prospective relief, notice and declaratory relief based solely on past violations of federal law are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Kenyon v. Sullivan, 761 F. Supp. 951, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5121 (D.R.I. 1991).

       <p>
        The immunity of a state from suit is a personal privilege which it may waive at pleasure. Briscoe v. President &amp; Directors of Bank of Kentucky, 36 U.S. (11 Pet.) 257, 9 L. Ed. 709, 1837 U.S. LEXIS 178 (1837).
       </p>
       <p>
        A state may give its consent to be sued in its own courts and at the same time exclude the jurisdiction of federal courts, subject always to the condition arising out of the supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the United States. Smith v. Reeves, 178 U.S. 436, 20 S. Ct. 919, 44 L. Ed. 1140, 1900 U.S. LEXIS 1691 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        A state which has waived its eleventh amendment immunity is not subject to suit for damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 or under an implied cause of action if its involvement in the wrong is no more than as employer of the offending officials. Naughton v. Bevilacqua, 458 F. Supp. 610, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15494 (D.R.I. 1978), aff'd, 605 F.2d 586, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 11703 (1st Cir. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The relinquishment of eleventh amendment rights, like the waiver of any constitutional right, is not likely to be inferred. Marrapese v. Rhode Island, 500 F. Supp. 1207, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14049 (D.R.I. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a state expressly waives its constitutional immunity in certain contexts militates against finding an implied waiver in other contexts. Marrapese v. Rhode Island, 500 F. Supp. 1207, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14049 (D.R.I. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is well established that a state’s waiver of sovereign immunity from suit in its own courts is not per se a waiver of constitutional immunity from suit in federal court. Marrapese v. Rhode Island, 500 F. Supp. 1207, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14049 (D.R.I. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a state has relinquished its sovereign immunity in its own courts is not determinative of whether it has waived its eleventh amendment immunity from suit in federal courts. Laird v. Chrysler Corp., 460 A.2d 425,
        <cite class="ri_code">

        , which unambiguously and without restriction holds the state “liable in all actions of tort in the same manner as a private individual or corporation [except for a limitation of damages] . . .” manifests, by overwhelming implication, a legislative intent to place the state in the same position as any other private litigant and thus amendable to suit in either state or federal court.

        constitutes a waiver of the state’s eleventh amendment immunity to tort suits in federal court. Rosen v. Chang, 758 F. Supp. 799, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3112 (D.R.I. 1991).

        The eleventh amendment defense sufficiently partakes of the nature of jurisdictional bar that it may be raised at any point in the proceedings. Vanlaarhoven v. Newman, 564 F. Supp. 145, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17586 (D.R.I. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that eleventh amendment immunity can be waived, and that courts have the discretion to raise eleventh amendment questions
    sua sponte,
        suggests that the amendment is just as much a grant of immunity, and thus a type of defense, as it is a limitation on the courts’ jurisdiction. Parella v. Retirement Bd. of the R.I. Employees' Retirement Sys., 173 F.3d 46, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 7488 (1st Cir. 1999).

        A suit against a bank to recover deposits is not a suit against the state although it is the sole proprietor of the stock. President &amp; Dirs. of Bank of Ky. v.

        A suit by trustees of a railroad company against state officers to compel them to assign to the trustees a lien held by the state upon the property covered by the trust deed pursuant to state law, is not a suit against the state. Rolston v. Missouri Fund Comm'rs, 120 U.S. 390, 7 S. Ct. 599, 30 L. Ed. 721, 1887 U.S. LEXIS 1986 (1887).

        Where the state constitution makes a county liable to suit as individuals, a suit against the county is not within the prohibition of this amendment, which limits jurisdiction to suits against the state. Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U.S. 529, 10 S. Ct. 363, 33 L. Ed. 766, 1890 U.S. LEXIS 1929 (1890).

        In a proceeding in which the state is neither formally nor in reality a party, its officers, though acting by the order of the state and for its benefit, may be restrained by injunction when the remedy at law is inadequate, from doing positive acts, for which they are personally and individually liable. Belknap v. Schild, 161 U.S. 10, 16 S. Ct. 443, 40 L. Ed. 599, 1896 U.S. LEXIS 2134 (1896), overruled in part, Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67, 1984 U.S. LEXIS 4 (1984).
       </p>

        A suit against state officers to enjoin them from enforcing a tax alleged to be in violation of United States Constitution is not a suit against the state. Gunter v. Atl. Coast Line R.R., 200 U.S. 273, 26 S. Ct. 252, 50 L. Ed. 477, 1906 U.S. LEXIS 1476 (1906).

        This amendment does not preclude suits against a wrongdoer merely because he asserts that his acts are within an official authority which the state does not confer. Worcester County Trust Co. v. Riley, 302 U.S. 292, 58 S. Ct. 185, 82 L. Ed. 268, 1937 U.S. LEXIS 547 (1937).

        This amendment bars suits where the liability must be paid from public funds in the state treasury even though the state is not named as a party to the action. Bowen v. Hackett, 387 F. Supp. 1212, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14329 (D.R.I. 1975).

        Only where an agency functions without meaningful fiscal and operational autonomy from the state can it partake of the state’s Eleventh Amendment immunity. Rhode Island Affiliate, American Civil Liberties Union, Inc. v. Rhode Island Lottery Comm'n, 553 F. Supp. 752, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16453 (D.R.I. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Factors to be considered in determining whether an agency is an arm of the state include the agency’s capacity to sue and be sued, the extent to which an agency has autonomy over its operations, whether the agency performs a traditional governmental function, and whether a judgment against an agency would be paid from the state treasury. The dispositive factor is “ultimate state liability” which rests on the degree to which the organization is financially dependent upon the state, and the extent to which the organization performs a state obligation or function. Vanlaarhoven v. Newman, 564 F. Supp. 145, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17586 (D.R.I. 1983).

        If an agency is not an alter ego of the state for eleventh amendment purposes, its employees and agents forfeit any eleventh amendment protection as well. Vanlaarhoven v. Newman, 564 F. Supp. 145, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17586 (D.R.I. 1983).

        The University of Rhode Island is not an alter ego of the state for eleventh amendment purposes. Vanlaarhoven v. Newman, 564 F. Supp. 145, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17586 (D.R.I. 1983); University of R.I. v. A.W. Chesterton Co., 721 F. Supp. 400, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12121 (D.R.I. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if the University of Rhode Island were considered an arm of the state, the state has waived eleventh amendment immunity for the board of governors for higher education and the University of Rhode Island through the statutory provision giving the board the right “to sue and be sued in its own name . . .” in §

        An action against the director of the department of corrections was an action against a state official in his official capacity as director of a state agency, and, because it alleged violations of state law, the action was, under the eleventh amendment, outside the jurisdiction of the federal courts.

        Employment security funds and temporary disability insurance funds are not a product of general taxation, but are from revenues collected from a particular group for whom the benefit of the funds accrue, for which the state is custodian, and where the state has specifically insulated itself from financial liability for payments from the funds, a suit for retroactive payments because of unconstitutional administration of the funds is not to be paid from public funds and is not barred by this amendment.

But in choosing the president, the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice. And if the house of representatives shall not choose a president whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next following, then the vice-president shall act as president, as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the president.

        A restraining order which prohibited defendants from a work stoppage by agreement or concerted action but which did not prohibit individuals from work stoppage did not violate this amendment. School Comm. v. Pawtucket Teachers Alliance,

        The Thirteenth Amendment is unusual in that it applies to the conduct between two private parties. Turner v. Unification Church, 473 F. Supp. 367, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14734 (D.R.I. 1978), aff'd, 602 F.2d 458, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 15296 (1st Cir. 1979).

       <p>
        Congress has actively protected the rights guaranteed by the Thirteenth Amendment by providing such often-used statutes as 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1985. Turner v. Unification Church, 473 F. Supp. 367, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14734 (D.R.I. 1978), aff'd, 602 F.2d 458, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 15296 (1st Cir. 1979).

       <p>
        The right to be free from involuntary servitude is a federally protected interest and therefore a federal court has the power to imply a cause of action in order to redress the violation of this interest. Turner v. Unification Church, 473 F. Supp. 367, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14734 (D.R.I. 1978), aff'd, 602 F.2d 458, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 15296 (1st Cir. 1979).

       <p>
        An interpretation of the thirteenth amendment to include tortious acts between two private individuals, such as false imprisonment, is neither necessary, prudent nor appropriate. Turner v. Unification Church, 473 F. Supp. 367, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14734 (D.R.I. 1978), aff'd, 602 F.2d 458, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 15296 (1st Cir. 1979).

        The housing authorities of cities, created by chapter 25 of title 45, are basically different from municipal corporations since they exercise both municipal and federal powers, have a dual public and private character, and are not created for political purposes nor strictly as instruments of the government for its own uses or subject to its complete control; therefore, such housing authorities are persons within the meaning of this amendment and as such have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a state statute under the due process and equal protection clauses.

        A litigant may assert the constitutional rights of a third party when (1) there is an integral relationship between the rights of the litigant and the rights of the third party or when (2) the third party is unable to assert such rights.

        Where the plaintiff had the opportunity to seek review in the state supreme court of the board of licenses’ rejection of his application for a license to offer adult entertainment, and could not establish that any such review would have been a sham, since the justices could have examined a record identical to the one presented to the district court, he failed to meet his burden of proof relative to inadequate state remedies, and his constitutional due process claim failed. D'Ambra v. City of Providence, 21 F. Supp. 2d 106, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15560 (D.R.I. 1998).

        An expectation that is not “property” for purposes of the takings clause may sometimes entitle the citizen to procedural protection and substantive protection against arbitrariness, before the expectation is cut off by government action.
        National Educ. Ass'n-Rhode Island by Scigulinsky v. Retirement Bd. of the R.I. Employees' Retirement Sys., 172 F.3d 22, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 5220 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 929, 120 S. Ct. 326, 145 L. Ed. 2d 254, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 6602 (1999).

        Where the class of persons who were “evicted” were individuals who were never public employees, at least in the capacity for which the state pensions were sought, and were permitted to enter the system at bargain-basement prices while retaining their pensions as union employees, the choice to evict them, returning their contributions with interest, was not so patently arbitrary, irrational, or unrelated to a legitimate legislative purpose as to constitute a violation of substantive due process.

This analysis requires consideration of three distinct factors: (1) the private interest that will be affected by the official action, (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used and the possible value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards, and (3) the government’s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirements would entail.

        An employee who loses his or her job or who is furloughed is not entitled to a hearing, despite the presence of a “no dismissal except for cause” rule, when the position is abolished pursuant to a bona fide government reorganization or kindred cost-cutting measure.

        State act which provides that membership of a public school teacher in a subversive organization plotting overthrow of the government by force is prima facie evidence of disqualification of a teacher, does not violate due process, if state act provides for a public hearing where teacher can present evidence overcoming the presumption. Adler v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 485, 72 S. Ct. 380, 96 L. Ed. 517, 1952 U.S. LEXIS 2387 (1952), overruled in part, Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 87 S. Ct. 675, 17 L.

        Identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: first, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the government’s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. Providence Teachers Union v. Donilon, 492 F. Supp. 709, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11771 (D.R.I. 1980); Lawrence v. Petit, 492 F. Supp. 1203, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11768 (D.R.I. 1980).

        Tenured teachers were not constitutionally entitled to a prenotice hearing since the process afforded by state law is adequate to provide that process which is due. Providence Teachers Union v. Donilon, 492 F. Supp. 709, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11771 (D.R.I. 1980).

        Although Rhode Island law does not provide a definitive answer to the question whether dismissed teacher could have raised her constitutional claims before the administrative bodies themselves, clearly she could have raised them before the Rhode Island courts upon review of the administrative actions and such claims could have been considered on the merits. Schiavulli v. Aubin, 504 F. Supp. 483, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15460 (D.R.I. 1980).

        When a district court’s subject matter jurisdiction is founded upon a federal question, the constitutional limits of the court’s personal jurisdiction are fixed, in the first instance, not by the fourteenth amendment but by the due process clause of the fifth amendment. New England Health Care Employees Union, Dist. 1199 v. Fall River Nursing Home, Inc., 802 F. Supp. 674, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15542 (D.R.I. 1992).

        Because the fourteenth amendment limits a state’s exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction, the minimum contacts analysis of International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.

        While the bankruptcy court has the inherent authority to enter a default judgment, where the plaintiff captioned his pleading to request merely the issuance of a “show cause order for entry of default,” the court was thereby limited and narrowed by the specific notice given to the defendant, and therefore, the notice did not afford defendant adequate due process, regarding the entry of default and a default judgment against it.

        Where the defendant’s strongest tie to the state was through her execution of a contract, which was negotiated and signed in another state and even stated in its title that it was a contract for that state’s employees, plaintiff’s cause of action did not arise out of or relate to defendant’s forum-state activities.

        Where a contract did little to confer on defendant any of the privileges or benefits of the forum state, but was essentially a list of conditions that defendant agreed to follow and rights defendant was giving up as a consequence of her employment, the only benefit to her was the predictability of the applicable law and the place of suit, her waiver of the right to challenge personal jurisdiction on Rhode Island was not a purposeful availment of the benefits of Rhode Island’s law, and she had not voluntarily interjected herself into the local economy as a market participant.

        A decedent’s occasional visits to Rhode Island for the purpose of advertising games and recruiting players did not meet the required standard of continuous and systematic contacts necessary to subject his estate to general personal jurisdiction in the state since advertising, even accompanied by the solicitation of orders, provides insufficient minimum contacts for the exercise of such jurisdiction.

        The existence of different limitation periods for suits for negligence and for wrongful death does not violate the equal protection rights of tort victims who die from their injuries, since there is a clear distinction between the nature of the plaintiffs involved which fully supports the state’s decision to treat the two types of plaintiff differently, i.e., the personal injury plaintiff’s initial need to recover from his injuries and to know the extent of his injuries, the likelihood of the community-disturbing event of death prompting more immediate focus by third parties upon the cause thereof, and the interest of both the survivors and the state in prompt settlement of the affairs of a deceased.

        Even if the filing of a notice of lis pendens constituted a taking with sufficient state involvement, the Rhode Island lis pendens procedure provides adequate constitutional safeguards since it specifies that a plaintiff shall give notice to all named parties within seven days after recording a notice of lis pendens, and a defendant may subsequently file a motion to quash an improperly filed lis pendens; there is no constitutional requirement that the landowner be given a hearing before the notice of lis pendens is filed.

        The test for determining whether evidence withheld by the prosecution during trial is material and subject to the constitutional duty of disclosure upon demand by the defendant is governed by the following criteria: if the omitted evidence creates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist, constitutional error has been committed, which means that the omission must be evaluated in the context of the entire record; if there is no reasonable doubt about guilt whether or not the additional evidence is considered, there is no justification for a new trial; if the verdict is already of questionable validity, additional evidence of relatively minor importance might be sufficient to create a reasonable doubt.

        Where defense counsel has directed general, nonspecific request to prosecutor for any exculpatory evidence, the standard of materiality governing whether any undisclosed evidence necessitates a new trial is that the additional evidence must be evaluated to determine whether it would have produced a reasonable doubt of guilt.

        Although there is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case, when a state does implement discovery procedures, the failure to comply with its rules, especially since the defense must presumably rely on such compliance in preparing a defense, may violate the defendant’s due-process rights to establish the best available defense.

        Where the trial justice found that the government in good faith did not learn of defendant’s confession until the eve of trial, defense counsel was promptly informed of the admission and the government’s intent to introduce it at trial, and the trial justice offered defendant an opportunity for a recess following the close of direct testimony eliciting the confession if he needed more time to prepare adequately before commencing cross-examination, it was clear that the trial justice adequately protected defendant’s due-process rights, right to effective assistance of counsel and right to a fair trial by affording him opportunities to request more time throughout the trial.

        Applicant was not entitled to postconviction relief, as the state’s failure to disclose its agreement about codefendant’s bail was inadvertent and did not prejudice him, because he knew she had been released on bail after she cooperated with state, and he was able to impeach her at trial with her cooperation agreement with the state. Had that agreement also stated that she would be released on bail if she cooperated, this would not have altered the outcome of the applicant’s trial. Gordon v. State, 18 A.3d 467,

        Defendant was not denied a fair trial because the counts in an indictment for first-degree child molestation sexual assault were not duplicitous, and a bill of particulars made clear that a single act was charged in each of the counts. Furthermore, defense counsel was afforded considerable latitude on cross-examination to explore with the complaining witness dates, times, locations, and circumstances regarding the different and disparate instances that were alleged in the indictment.

        At hearing on motion of attorney general to impose deferred sentence on defendant for violation of deferred sentence agreement, where, according to defendant’s sworn statement, counsel was appointed for him only a few minutes before the hearing with no opportunity for meaningful conferring, defendant was denied his right of counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and made applicable to the states by virtue of the due process clause of this amendment, notwithstanding defendant failed to furnish Supreme Court with transcript of hearing, since court was persuaded that the transcript would have shed no light on this allegation and applied the rule that sworn statements in petitions for extraordinary writs that are not denied are assumed to be true.

        Although generally a defendant has a constitutional right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to cross-examine a prosecution witness as to his present residence, without any obligation to explain the purpose of the questioning, where the personal safety of the witness is involved, the witness has been placed in his proper setting or environment and the defendant fails to demonstrate he has suffered any harm from the failure to disclose the witness’ exact address, such cross-examination may be properly excluded.

        In drug case, where defense sought to impeach state witness by showing that she had been charged with prostitution but that the charge later was reduced, defendant’s right to effective cross-examination was not compromised by the exclusion of such evidence, as the defense could not impugn the witness’ moral character without some proof that the reduction of the charge was related to the witness’ decision to testify.

        Evidence of a prior acquittal of a coindicted defendant (although not present at trial) in another state, when the evidence relates to the identical chain of events and concerns the same individuals, is probative of a complaining witness’s credibility and thus should be placed before the trier of fact; such exclusion denies the defendants due process of law and as a result constitutes an error of constitutional dimensions.

        Where the trial justice is satisfied that a sexual assault victim’s in-court identification of the defendant is based upon her observation at the time of the assault, and the record amply supports the trial justice’s finding, the trial justice does not err in admitting the in-court identification.

        Instruction in second-degree murder prosecution that “there is also a presumption that a person intends all of the natural and probable consequences of his voluntary acts” violated the Fourteenth Amendment requirement that the prosecution prove every element of the offense of murder beyond a reasonable doubt in that intent was an element of the crime charged and that the challenged instruction was made without any indication that the presumption could be rebutted, or that certain circumstances would allow the jurors to ignore the presumption.

        In a murder prosecution, the trial court’s aiding and abetting instruction accurately reflected the law with respect to intent because it explained that only if defendant knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted could he be held responsible for the natural or probable consequences of that act.

        Strict scrutiny review is applied to all statutes and state-supported rules that classify individuals by race or ethnicity. Classifications by race or ethnicity demand strict scrutiny because no situation justifies the state from classifying individuals by race or ethnicity. Classifying persons according to race or ethnicity is more likely to reflect prejudice than legitimate public concern. Thus the strict scrutiny analysis is applied, and almost without exception racial or ethnic classifications are struck down as violations of equal protection. Kleczek v.

        The Rhode Island Board of Elections violated the plaintiff ’s rights to due process and equal protection under the first and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution by refusing to certify her candidacy for election as a delegate to the Democratic national convention on the grounds that she did not comply with a state law requiring that the name and address stated on her declaration correspond exactly to her name and address as set forth on the voting list.

        prohibiting employees of the United States, the state, or a city or town from serving as election officials, but exempting public school employees, school teachers, and the town of Westerly, was unconstitutional on its face as a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and it unreasonably discriminated against plaintiff, a secretary for a government agency who wanted to serve as a polling official.

        The rigorousness of a court’s inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the extent to which a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. When the right to vote is subjected to severe restrictions, the regulation must be narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance; when the state law imposes only reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions upon the rights of voters, the state’s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify the restrictions.

        Zoning ordinances, like other forms of social and economic regulation that do not implicate “fundamental rights,” satisfy the requirements of substantive due process if they are rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Consequently, they should be upheld unless clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.

        Ordinance providing for the rezoning of commercial and industrial areas to residential areas, and increasing minimum lot size to 4.6 acres in some segments of town and to 2.6 acres in others, does not violate due process.

        A town’s efforts to strike a balance between environmental and economic concerns was amply evidenced by the discussion at the public hearing antecedent to the adoption of an amended zoning ordinance, which hearing was precisely what takings jurisprudence required it to do. South County Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. Town of S. Kingstown, 160 F.3d 834, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 30849 (1st Cir. 1998).

       <p>
        Where a permit application process only required that excavators apply for permits, and did not provide for their automatic denial, and where the process allowed the town to closely monitor developments on real estate containing non-conforming uses, this was a means of securing the town’s legitimate goals of conserving its natural resources and did not render the zoning ordinance vulnerable to a facial challenge. South County Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. Town of S. Kingstown, 160 F.3d 834, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 30849 (1st Cir. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether viewed from the vantage point of substantive due process or takings clause jurisprudence, the means/ends nexus frames the central inquiry for an abstract challenge to a zoning law and, whether or not a particular piece of legislation is bad policy, it will survive an abstract substantive due process or takings challenge as long as the means that it embodies are substantially related to a legitimate governmental purpose.

        Even if the limited liability company could have established that the zoning certificates gave rise to a constitutionally protected property right, it could not establish that it was deprived of that interest without due process of law; the fact that the LLC was not provided with a hearing prior to the deprivation of its purported property right did not, by itself, establish a violation of due process. Moreover, the post-deprivation procedural safeguards were more than adequate to satisfy the requirements of procedural due process. Pawtucket Transfer Operations, LLC v. City of Pawtucket, 539 F.

        Population variances of less than ten percent in state reapportionment plans are of prima facie constitutional validity; and in light of the deference that must be afforded to state reapportionment plans, when such a plan has a total deviation of less than ten percent, it does not violate the one-person, one-vote principle merely because a population window was used in developing that plan.

        Where statutory and case law was unsettled as to boundary between littoral owners and shore, city trespass ordinance could not be enforced against defendants who believed that shoreline extended to high-water mark, since due process provides that no person be held criminally responsible for conduct not reasonably understood to be proscribed.

        , relating to provision of police and fire services during a labor strike or lockout, is unconstitutionally vague, since it is unclear whether security guard services provided by off-duty police officers to a private corporation during a labor dispute are allowed, restricted, or forbidden, because that section does not state whether an off-duty police officer is an agent, servant, or employee, and because it is unclear from the language of the section whether private security guard services provided by off-duty police officers would be considered “police services” and, therefore, a function of the municipality.

        A civil statute is subjected to a lesser standard of scrutiny for vagueness than that afforded a criminal statute. City of Warwick v. Aptt, 497 A.2d 721,

        In order for a statute to be found to be unconstitutionally vague and therefore violative of the due-process clause of the amendment, the statute must be such that its wording fails to alert the public of the statute’s scope and meaning. City of Warwick v. Aptt, 497 A.2d 721,

        , which authorizes the suspension of a driver’s license without a preliminary hearing if the driver “has been involved as a driver in any accident resulting in the death or personal injury of another,” is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to set forth any standard to be used when determining if the driver’s license should be revoked. Due process requires that a driver at least have an opportunity for a hearing before a license may be suspended.

        A law which does not reach constitutionally protected conduct and, therefore, surmounts the overbreadth test, may nevertheless be challenged as on its face unduly vague, in violation of due process. For such a facial challenge to succeed, however, the complainant must demonstrate that the law is impermissibly vague in all of its applications. Whiting v. Town of Westerly, 942 F.2d 18, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 18100 (1st Cir. 1991).

        A plaintiff who engages in conduct that is clearly proscribed by a statute cannot complain that the statute is vague on its face nor challenge the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others. Whiting v. Town of Westerly, 942 F.2d 18, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 18100 (1st Cir. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with a sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. United States v. Campbell, 61 F.3d 976, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 20196 (1st Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1161, 116 S. Ct. 1556, 134 L. Ed. 2d 657, 1996 U.S. LEXIS 2777 (1996).

        Any marginal First Amendment interest the bar-owning plaintiffs may have had in topless barroom dancing was outweighed by the state’s Twenty-First Amendment interest in regulating the circumstances under which liquor may be served. Thus, a city ordinance prohibiting nude dancing in a bar served a legitimate state purpose and was rationally related to the achievement of the purpose. Wreck Bar v. Comolli, 857 F.

        Rhode Island’s statutory prohibition against advertisements that provide the public with accurate information about retail prices of alcoholic beverages is unconstitutional; this holding rests on the conclusion that such an advertising ban is an abridgment of speech protected by the First Amendment and that it is not shielded from constitutional scrutiny by the Twenty-first Amendment. 44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 116 S. Ct. 1495, 134 L. Ed. 2d 711, 1996 U.S. LEXIS 3020 (1996).

      Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.

Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.
