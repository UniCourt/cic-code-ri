         The board of directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (a)(3) of this section either on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.

         A corporation’s indebtedness to a shareholder incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the corporation’s indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors except to the extent subordinated by agreement.

        <li id="t07c1.2p06s7-1.2-614ol1a7">
         Indebtedness of a corporation, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of determinations under subsection (a)(3) of this section if its terms of the indebtedness provide that payment of principal and interest are made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section. If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made.

         Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, shares may be issued pro rata and without consideration to the corporation’s shareholders or to the shareholders of one or more classes or series. An issuance of shares under this subsection is a share distribution.

       For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment of a meeting of shareholders, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of directors of a corporation may provide that stock transfer books are closed for a stated period, not less than that specified in any applicable bylaw and not more than sixty (60) days. In lieu of closing the stock transfer books, the bylaws, or in the absence of an applicable bylaw, the board of directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for any determination of shareholders, the date in any case to be not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring the determination of shareholders, is to be taken. If the stock transfer books are not closed and no record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the board of directors declaring the dividend is adopted, as the case may be, is the record date for the determination of shareholders.

       In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date may not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by this chapter, is the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in this state, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to a corporation’s registered office must be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by this chapter, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting is the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

       Any number of shareholders of a corporation may create a voting trust for the purpose of conferring upon a trustee or trustees the right to vote or otherwise represent their shares, for a period not to exceed ten (10) years, by entering into a written voting trust agreement specifying the terms and conditions of the voting trust, by depositing a counterpart of the agreement with the corporation at its registered office, and by transferring their shares to the trustee or trustees for the purposes of the agreement. The trustee or trustees shall keep a record of the holders of voting trust certificates evidencing a beneficial interest in the voting trust, giving the names and addresses of all the holders and the number and class of the shares in respect of which the voting trust certificates held by each are issued, and shall deposit a copy of the record with the corporation at its registered office. The counterpart of the voting trust agreement and the copy of the record deposited with the corporation are subject to the same right of examination by a shareholder of the corporation, in person or by agent or attorney, as are the books and records of the corporation, and the counterpart and the copy of the record is subject to examination by any holder of record of voting trust certificates, either in person or by agent or attorney, at any reasonable time for any proper purpose. The trust certificates must state that they are issued pursuant to the voting trust agreement, and that fact must be stated in the stock ledger of the corporation.

      <li id="t07c1.2p07s7-1.2-709ol1c">
       The provisions of this section are construed as permissive and should not be interpreted to invalidate any voting or other agreement among shareholders, or any irrevocable proxy which is otherwise not illegal.

       A voting trust or shareholders agreement may at any time or times be extended for an additional period not in excess of ten (10) years, but the extension is binding only with respect to those shares owned of record or beneficially by parties to the extension.

      The board of directors of a corporation consists of one or more members. The number of directors is fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the articles of incorporation or the bylaws. The number of directors may be increased or decreased from time to time by amendment to, or in the manner provided in, the articles of incorporation or the bylaws, but no decrease has the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director.

      , the number of directors may not be decreased unless approved by the shareholders with less than the number of shares previously entitled to elect one director voting against the decrease. Initial directors hold office until the first annual meeting of shareholders, and until their successors have been elected and qualified. At the first annual meeting of shareholders and at each subsequent annual meeting, the shareholders shall elect directors to hold office until the next succeeding annual meeting, except in the case of the classification of directors as permitted by this chapter. Each director holds office for the term for which he or she is elected and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified. Any director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing to the corporation.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When the board of directors consists of nine (9) or more members, in lieu of electing the whole number of directors annually, the articles of incorporation may provide that the directors be divided into either two (2) or three (3) classes, each class to be as nearly equal in number as possible, the term of office of directors of the first class to expire at the first annual meeting of shareholders after their election, that of the second class to expire at the second annual meeting after their election, and that of the third class, if any, to expire at the third annual meeting after their election. At each annual meeting after the classification, the number of directors equal to the number of the class whose term expires at the time of the meeting will be elected to hold office until the second succeeding annual meeting, if there are two (2) classes, or until the third succeeding annual meeting, if there are three (3) classes. No classification of directors is effective prior to the first annual meeting of shareholders. The articles of incorporation may confer upon holders of any class or series of shares the right to elect one or more directors who serve for any term and have any voting powers stated in the articles of incorporation. The terms of office and voting powers of the directors elected in the manner provided in the articles of incorporation may be greater than or less than those of any other director or class of directors.

      Any vacancy occurring in the board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum of the board of directors. A director elected to fill a vacancy is elected for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by the board of directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the shareholders. If at any time, by reason of death, resignation or other cause, a corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any shareholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a shareholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a shareholder, may call a special meeting of shareholders in accordance with the provisions of the articles of incorporation or the bylaws, or may apply to the superior court for a decree summarily ordering a meeting for the purposes of conducting an election.

        Setting Aside of Sales.

       Since a director of a corporation stands in a fiduciary relationship toward its stockholders, a sale by an officer-director of fishing boats and a gasoline engine belonging to the corporation, without prior authorization or later ratification by the board of directors or stockholders, may be set aside by the corporation.

       A corporation being entitled to set aside the unauthorized sale of corporate property by a director to himself is not estopped because of retention of money paid contemporaneously with the sale, since it cannot be charged with acquiescence of the transaction unless it had full knowledge of the facts, or once having acquired it substantially later, delayed unduly thereafter in commencing suit. Point Trap Co. v. Manchester,
       <cite class="ri_code">

       Money paid to the corporation by an officer-director for property belonging to the corporation which he has sold to himself may not be retained by the corporation, because if it is allowed to cancel and set aside the sale, justice requires that the officer-director be put in status quo and have restored to him that which he has paid.

       Any shareholder electing to exercise the right of dissent shall file with the corporation, prior to or at the meeting of shareholders at which the proposed corporate action is submitted to a vote, a written objection to the proposed corporate action. If the proposed corporate action is approved by the required vote and the shareholder has not voted in favor of it, the shareholder may, within ten (10) days after the date on which the vote was taken, or if a corporation is to be merged without a vote of its shareholders into another corporation, any of its shareholders may, within fifteen (15) days after the plan of the merger has been mailed to the shareholders, make written demand on the corporation, or, in the case of a merger, on the surviving or new corporation, domestic or foreign, for payment of the fair value of the shareholder’s shares. If the proposed corporate action is effected, the corporation shall pay to the shareholder, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares, the fair value of the shares as of the day prior to the date on which the vote was taken approving the proposed corporate action, excluding any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the corporate action. Any shareholder failing to make demand within the ten (10) day period or the fifteen (15) day period, as the case may be, is bound by the terms of the proposed corporate action. Any shareholder making the demand is thereafter only entitled to payment as provided in this section and is not entitled to vote or to exercise any other rights of a shareholder.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c1.2p12s7-1.2-1202ol1b">
       No demand may be withdrawn unless the corporation consents to it. If, however, the demand is withdrawn upon consent, or if the proposed corporate action is abandoned or rescinded or the shareholders revoke the authority to effect the action, or if, in the case of a merger, on the date of the filing of the articles of merger the surviving corporation is the owner of all the outstanding shares of the other corporations, domestic and foreign, that are parties to the merger, or if no demand or petition for the determination of fair value by a court has been made or filed within the time provided in this section, or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the shareholder is not entitled to the relief provided by this section, then the right of the shareholder to be paid the fair value of his or her shares ceases and his status as a shareholder is restored, without prejudice to any corporate proceedings taken during the interim.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c1.2p12s7-1.2-1202ol1c">
       Within ten (10) days after the corporate action is effected, the corporation, or, in the case of a merger, the surviving or new corporation, domestic or foreign, shall give written notice of the action to each dissenting shareholder who has made demand as provided in these provisions, and shall make a written offer to each dissenting shareholder to pay for the shares at a specified price deemed by the corporation to be the fair value of the shares. The notice and offer must be accompanied by a balance sheet of the corporation the shares of which the dissenting shareholder holds, as of the latest available date and not more than twelve (12) months prior to the making of the offer, and a profit and loss statement of the corporation for the twelve (12) month period ended on the date of the balance sheet.

       If within thirty (30) days after the date on which the corporate action was effected the fair value of the shares is agreed upon between any dissenting shareholder and the corporation, payment for the shares must be made within ninety (90) days after the date on which the corporate action was effected, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares. Upon payment of the agreed value, the dissenting shareholder ceases to have any interest in the shares.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c1.2p12s7-1.2-1202ol1e">
       If within the period of thirty (30) days a dissenting shareholder and the corporation do not agree on the matter, then the corporation, within thirty (30) days after receipt of written request for the filing from any dissenting shareholder given within sixty (60) days after the date on which the corporate action was effected, shall, or at its election at any time within the period of sixty (60) days may, file a petition in any court of competent jurisdiction in the county in this state where the registered office of the corporation is located praying that the fair value of the shares is found and determined. If, in the case of a merger, the surviving or new corporation is a foreign corporation without a registered office in this state, the petition must be filed in the county where the registered office of the domestic corporation was last located. If the corporation fails to institute the proceeding as provided, any dissenting shareholder may do so in the name of the corporation. All dissenting shareholders, wherever they reside, must be made parties to the proceeding as an action against their shares quasi in rem. A copy of the petition must be served on each dissenting shareholder who is a resident of this state and served by registered or certified mail on each dissenting shareholder who is a nonresident. Service on nonresidents may also be made by publication as provided by law. The jurisdiction of the court is plenary and exclusive. All shareholders who are parties to the proceeding are entitled to judgment against the corporation for the amount of the fair value of their shares. The court may, if it so elects, appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers have the power and authority that is specified in the order of their appointment or an amendment of the order. The judgment is payable only upon and concurrently with the surrender to the corporation of the certificate or certificates representing the shares. Upon payment of the judgment, the dissenting shareholder ceases to have any interest in the shares.

       The court shall determine and assess the costs and expenses of any proceeding against the corporation, but all or any part of the costs and expenses may be apportioned and assessed as the court deems equitable against any or all of the dissenting shareholders who are parties to the proceeding to whom the corporation has made an offer to pay for the shares if the court finds that the action of the shareholders in failing to accept the offer was arbitrary or vexatious or not in good faith. The expenses include reasonable compensation for and reasonable expenses of the appraisers, but exclude the fees and expenses of counsel for and experts employed by any party; but if the fair value of the shares as determined materially exceeds the amount which the corporation offered to pay for the shares, or if no offer was made, the court in its discretion may award to any shareholder who is a party to the proceeding a sum that the court determines to be reasonable compensation to any expert or experts employed by the shareholder in the proceeding.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c1.2p12s7-1.2-1202ol1h">
       Within twenty (20) days after demanding payment for his or her shares, each shareholder demanding payment shall submit the certificate or certificates representing his or her shares to the corporation for notation on the certificate that the demand has been made. His or her failure to do so may, at the option of the corporation, terminate his or her rights under this section unless a court of competent jurisdiction, for good and sufficient cause shown, directs otherwise. If shares represented by a certificate on which notation has been made are transferred, each new certificate issued for the shares must bear similar notation, together with the name of the original dissenting holder of the shares, and a transferee of the shares acquires by the transfer no rights in the corporation other than those which the original dissenting shareholder had after making demand for payment of the fair value of the shares.

       Shares acquired by a corporation pursuant to payment of the agreed value for the shares or to payment of the judgment entered for the shares, as provided in this section, may be held and disposed of by the corporation. However, in the case of a merger, they may be held and disposed of as the plan of merger otherwise provides.

        The provisions linking the measure of damages for conversion with the phrase “full and fair value” were not intended to define restrictively the meaning of that phrase but rather were intended to fix the time as of which such value was to be determined by an exercise of the appraisal procedure.

        If the shareholder seeks nothing more than the value of his shares, then appraisal is the exclusive remedy. On the other hand, when there are allegations of fraud, unfair dealing or breaches of fiduciary obligations, the plaintiff should not be deprived of other remedies such as rescission and injunctive relief that might be necessary to restore him to the position he otherwise would have occupied.

       The official notice sent to a corporation of the revocation of its articles of association for failure to file its annual report was admissible to deny it de facto corporation status and to assign personal liability against the defendants, especially given that no reinstatement of the corporate charter was either sought or obtained.

        Appointment of a temporary receiver for the owner of the majority of the condominium units in a condominium – which was also the declarant of the condominium and sold the petitioners’ condominium units to them – was inappropriate because the petitioners lacked standing to file a motion to appoint a temporary receiver in the matter as the petitioners were neither shareholders nor creditors of the owner.

      or is otherwise valid, one or more of its other shareholders may avoid the dissolution by filing with the court prior to the commencement of the hearing, or, in the discretion of the court, at any time prior to a sale or other disposition of the assets of the corporation, an election to purchase the shares owned by the petitioner at a price equal to their fair value. If the shares are to be purchased by other shareholders, notice must be sent to all shareholders of the corporation other than the petitioner, giving them an opportunity to join in the election to purchase the shares. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as to the fair value of the shares, the court shall, upon the giving of a bond or other security sufficient to assure to the petitioner payment of the value of the shares, stay the proceeding and determine the value of the shares, in accordance with the procedure set forth in §

      , as of the close of business on the day on which the petition for dissolution was filed. Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall state in its order directing that the shares be purchased, the purchase price and the time within which the payment is to be made, and may decree any other terms and conditions of sale that it determines to be appropriate, including payment of the purchase price in installments extending over a period of time, and, if the shares are to be purchased by shareholders, the allocation of shares among shareholders electing to purchase them, which, so far as practicable, are to be proportional to the number of shares previously owned. The petitioner is entitled to interest, at the rate on judgments in civil actions, on the purchase price of the shares from the date of the filing of the election to purchase the shares, and all other rights of the petitioner as owner of the shares terminate on that date. The costs of the proceeding, which include reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers but not fees and expenses of counsel or of experts retained by a party, will be allocated between or among the parties as the court determines. Upon full payment of the purchase price, under the terms and conditions specified by the court, or at any other time that is ordered by the court, the petitioner shall transfer the shares to the purchaser.

        The language in the stock buyout statute which provides that a court “may decree such other terms and conditions of sale as it determines to be appropriate, including payment of the purchase price in installments extending over a period of time,” does not override state law which governs priorities, liens, and attachments.

        Whether or not this section means to provide a corporation with total freedom to change its mind and revoke a previous buyout election, the statute gives the court, faced with a buyout election and a valuation impasse, the legal power to require the corporation to post security.

       <p>
        The “appropriate” terms and conditions provision of the stock buyout statute is directed to the mechanics of the stock purchase and payment as between the company and the former shareholder, and does not allow the judge in the stock buyout case to override state lien law protecting the interests of third parties to other cases merely because the proceeds happen to derive from an award made by the judge.

       <p>
        By conditioning the election to purchase shares on the owner’s shareholder status, the purchaser was merely holding the shareholder to his proof in establishing his rightful ownership of the shares, a necessary statutory precondition to the shareholder’s initiation and maintenance of a dissolution claim and to the purchaser’s invocation of his buyout election. DiLuglio v. Providence Auto Body, Inc., 755 A.2d 757,

        A purchaser of shares was entitled to condition his election upon the shareholder’s rightful ownership of shares, subject to the risk that if his position challenging that ownership turned out to be a frivolous one or one taken in bad faith he would be subject to sanctions.

        Although the intended rate for prejudgment interest could have been specified more clearly, the purpose of the provision to award prejudgment interest compels the application of the state’s prejudgment rate, not the post-judgment rate.

        Default judgment entered against a corporation that had already been dissolved for over two years when the service was effected against it was void ab initio because former § 7-1.1-98 (now this section) provided a two-year statute of repose to bring the action and, beyond that time, there was no right to maintain a cause of action against a dissolved corporation.

        The official notice sent to a corporation of the revocation of its articles of association for failure to file its annual report was admissible to deny it de facto corporation status and to assign personal liability against the defendants, especially given that no reinstatement of the corporate charter was either sought or obtained.

        Stockholders have a statutory right to inspect corporate books and records. Sarni v. Meloccaro,

       <p>
        A corporation is under a legal duty to permit a records examination requested by a minority shareholder if the request is made in good faith and for a proper purpose; the corporation is not excused from doing so merely because the shareholder previously breached a fiduciary duty to the corporation. Any legitimate concern that the corporation may have about the shareholder’s good faith, the propriety of the demand, or the potential misuse of corporate records should be presented to a court for its consideration and possible entry of a protective order concerning such activity. Long v. Atlantic PBS, 681 A.2d 249,

        An order giving a stockholder access to the corporation’s books and records was proper insofar as it granted him access to records relevant to his stated purpose of evaluating a proposed dividend, but it should have denied access to such proprietary information as customer and supplier lists, contract bids, or profit margins and discounts.

        Superior court properly dismissed an employee/shareholder’s claim under the Business Corporation Act (BCA) because the alleged violations of the BCA by the corporation and its president—how shareholder meetings were conducted and the process by which shareholders and others exercised their right to review a corporation’s books and records—qualified as “internal affairs” that Rhode Island was unauthorized to regulate because the corporation was incorporated in Delaware; supporting this conclusion was the fact that

       If any shareholder becomes ineligible, he or she shall transfer his or her shares to an eligible person or offer them to the corporation for redemption at their fair-market value. If the articles of incorporation or the bylaws of the corporation restrict transfer of its shares, and transfer of the shares to an eligible person is prevented, the corporation shall redeem the shares of the ineligible shareholder, and compensate the ineligible shareholder in full for the fair-market value of his or her shares determined as of the date that the ineligibility occurred. Nothing contained in these provisions is to be interpreted to prevent a shareholder and the corporation from making a binding agreement as to a method for determining the fair-market value or for determining what constitutes the fair-market value of his or her shares. In the event the corporation and an ineligible shareholder cannot agree as to the fair-market value, the regulatory agency excluding the division of professional regulation shall, upon application by either party, appoint a board of not less than three (3) qualified persons engaged in performing similar professional services to determine the fair-market value of the shares, and the decision of the board is final and binding upon the parties. The division of professional regulation shall, upon application by either party, appoint a neutral arbitrator with experience in business valuation whose fees will be paid by the corporation petitioner to determine the fair-market value of the shares, and the decision of the arbitrator is final and binding upon the parties. The redemption of its shares by a professional service corporation shall not be effected at a time or in a manner so as to impair or prejudice the rights or remedies of any creditor of the corporation. As used in this chapter, “ineligible shareholder” includes a shareholder electing to retire or withdraw from active employment in the corporation. Nothing contained in these provisions is to be interpreted to prohibit the temporary exercise of incidence of ownership of stock in any corporation by persons or corporate fiduciaries not authorized to practice, solely for purposes of administering estates of shareholders deceased or under legal disability to transfer their shares. For purposes of this section, “temporary incidence of ownership” means any period of time not exceeding two (2) years; and “administering estates of shareholders” shall include, but not be limited to, contracting with licensed professionals to operate the practice upon the death of the person licensed to practice.

        Trial court judgment dismissing the complaint filed by shareholders against a corporation, its officers and directors, and an auction house, was upheld on appeal, because the action of the officers and directors in voting to sell a valuable folio of five prints was within their powers under the corporation’s bylaws and the shareholders had no proprietary interest in the sale. The shareholders failed to show any impropriety with regard to the bylaws and, therefore, their attempt to block the sale of the folio failed since the corporation’s action was not ultra vires.

      Each corporation has the power to make guarantees, although not in furtherance of its corporate purposes, when authorized at a meeting of members by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members entitled to vote on the guarantees, or a greater percentage that may be provided by the articles of incorporation or bylaws, or if there are no members, or no members entitled to vote on the guarantees, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors in office, or a greater percentage that is provided by the articles of incorporation or bylaws. If authorized by a like vote, a corporation has the power to mortgage, pledge, or give a security interest in all or any of its property, franchises, and income to secure the guarantee or to secure obligations other than its own.

       Trial court judgment dismissing the complaint filed by shareholders against a corporation, its officers and directors, and an auction house, was upheld on appeal because the action of the officers and directors in voting to sell a valuable folio of five prints was within their powers under the corporation’s bylaws and the shareholders had no proprietary interest in the sale. The shareholders failed to show any impropriety with regard to the bylaws and, therefore, their attempt to block the sale of the folio failed since the corporation’s action was not ultra vires.

      The marketing contract of any association formed under this chapter may fix as liquidated damages, specific, reasonable sums to be paid by a member to the association upon the breach by him or her of any provisions of the marketing contract regarding the sale or delivery or withholding of products. It may also provide that the member will pay all costs, premiums for bonds, expenses, and fees in case any action is brought upon the contract by the association, and any provisions are valid and enforceable in the courts of this state. In the event of a breach, or threatened breach, of the marketing contract by a member, the board of directors may authorize one of the executive officers of the association to apply to the superior court for the counties of Providence and Bristol for an injunction to prevent the further breach of the contract and for a decree for the specific performance of the contract. Pending the adjudication of the petition, the court, upon the filing of a sufficient bond by the association, may grant any temporary relief that seems to it just and proper.

        Since the state uniform securities statute was not intended to supersede or replace common-law actions that might rely upon similar facts in seeking compensation for tortious acts committed by a broker or investment advisor, the plaintiff’s common-law claims for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and misrepresentation were subject to the 10-year general statute of limitations, not the one year permitted under the securities statute.

      A security may be registered in beneficiary form if the form is authorized by this or a similar statute of the state of organization of the issuer or registering entity, the location of the registering entity’s principal office, the office of its transfer agent or its office making the registration, or by this or a similar statute of the law of the state listed as the owner’s address at the time of registration. A registration governed by the law of a jurisdiction in which this, or similar legislation, is not in force or was not in force when a registration in beneficiary form was made is nevertheless presumed to be valid and authorized as a matter of contract law.

The members of the partnership so proceeded against are permitted to set off any demand against the creditor that could have been set off had the suit been against all the individuals composing the firm. They may avail themselves of any defense that would have been available had not this chapter been passed, except that they shall not set up the discharge of one individual as a discharge of all the other copartners, unless it appears that all were intended to be discharged.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       UPA (1997) section 101 defined fourteen terms. This section defines twenty-four terms.
       The increase is generally due to harmonization and more particularly to changes made to bring
       the LLP provisions pertaining to limited liability and filings into line with the corresponding
       provisions of ULPA (2001) (Last Amended 2013) and ULLCA (2006) (Last Amended 2013).
       See, e.g.
    , Sections 111–117 (provisions pertaining to filings), 407 (liability for improper
       distributions).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section contains definitions for terms used throughout the act; it is important to
       remember that “partnership” means solely a domestic general partnership, except when
       “partnership” is used as part of a multiword-term (
    e.g.
    , “foreign partnership”). Section 1101
       contains definitions specific to Article 11’s provisions on mergers, conversions, interest
       exchanges, and domestications.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Business” [(1)]
       </b>
       —This definition originated in UPA (1914) § 2 and is fundamentally
       important; a general partnership must have a business purpose.
       See
    Section 202(a) (referring to
       the association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit).
       <i>
        Compare
       </i>
       Section 102(1),
       <i>
        with
       </i>
       ULPA (2001) (Last Amended 2013) § 110(b) (“A limited partnership may
       have any lawful purpose, regardless of whether for profit.”),
       <i>
        and
       </i>
       ULLCA (2006) (Last Amended
       2013) § 108(a) (same as to a limited liability company).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Contribution” [(2)]
       </b>
       —This definition is based on ULPA (2001) § 102(2)
       (“Contribution”, except in the phrase “right of contribution”, means any benefit provided by a
       person to a limited partnership in order to become a partner or in the person’s capacity as a
       partner.”). UPA (1997) did not define “contribution.” The Harmonization Project added this
       definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       This definition serves to distinguish capital contributions from other circumstances under
       which a partner or would-be partner might provide benefits to a general partnership (
    e.g.
    ,
       providing services to the partnership as an employee or independent contractor, leasing property
       to the partnership).
      </p>
      <p>
       This definition also distinguishes “contributions” from capital raised from transferees
       who invest; to be a contribution, the property or benefit must be “provided by a person … to
       become a partner or in the person’s capacity as a partner. This distinction is ubiquitous in the law
       of unincorporated business organizations. See, e.g., ULPA (2001) § 102(2) definition (quoted
       above);
       N.Y. Ltd. Liab. Co. Law § 102(f) (McKinney 2013) (“‘Contribution’ means any cash,
       property, services rendered, or a promissory note or other binding obligation to contribute cash or
       property or to render services that a member contributes to a limited liability company in his or her capacity as a member.”)
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, partnership agreements sometimes provide for contributions from transferees.
       In such circumstances, the default rules for liquidating distributions should be altered accordingly.
       See
    Section 806(b)(1) (referring to distributions to be made “to each person owning
       a transferable interest that reflects
       <i>
        contributions
       </i>
       made and not previously returned.”) (emphasis
       added).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Distribution” [(4)(A)—redemptions included]
       </b>
       —This provision specifically refers to
       transactions between a general partnership and one of its partners, which in the corporate context
       would be labeled “redemption.” The paragraph has subparts because ownership interests in a
       partnership are conceptually bifurcated into economic rights (“transferable interest”), and
       governance and information rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 405(a), “[a]ny distribution made by a partnership before its dissolution and
       winding up must be in equal shares among partners, except to the extent necessary to comply
       with a transfer effective under Section 503 or charging order in effect under Section 504.” Since
       a redemption is a distribution, absent authorization in the partnership agreement a partnership
       may not redeem the interest of one partner or transferee without redeeming (or at least offering to
       redeem) the interests of all other partners and transferees to a comparable extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The law of close corporations has flirted with a similar notion.
       See, e.g., Donahue v. Rodd
       Electrotype Co. of New England, Inc.
    , 328 N.E.2d 505, 518 (Mass. 1975) (stating, with regard to
       closely held corporations, “if the stockholder whose shares were purchased was a member of the
       controlling group, the controlling stockholders must cause the corporation to offer each
       stockholder an equal opportunity to sell a ratable number of his shares to the corporation at an
       identical price”);
       <i>
        cf. Wilkes v. Springside Nursing Home, Inc.
       </i>
       , 353 N.E.2d 657, 663 (Mass. 1976)
       (stating that “untempered application of the strict good faith standard enunciated in
       <i>
        Donahue
       </i>
       … will result in the imposition of limitations on legitimate action by the controlling group in a close
       corporation which will unduly hamper its effectiveness in managing the corporation in the best
       interests of all concerned”).
       <i>
        See also Toner v. Baltimore Envelope Co.
       </i>
       , 498 A.2d 642, 650 (Md.
       1985) (rejecting the “per se breach of duty” approach).
      </p>
      <p>
       A partnership agreement can override Section 405(a)’s equal treatment requirement
       without specifically mentioning redemptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Ryan Company is a general partnership whose partnership agreement:
       (i) includes a list (the “protected list”) of decisions or actions that may be taken only with
       the consent of all partners; and (ii) provides that all other decisions and acts may be taken
       as the Management Committee determines. The protected list does not include
       redemptions. The partnership agreement overrides the Section 404(a)’s equal treatment
       requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        [(4)(B)—exclusion]
       </b>
       —This exclusion affects the reach of: (i) the charging order remedy
       under Section 504; and (ii) Section 407’s clawback provision applicable to distributions made by
       a limited liability partnership. The effect on the clawback provision reflects the law in several
       states,
       see, e.g.
    ,
       Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, § 15-309(a) (2014);
       Va. Code Ann. § 13.1-1036 (2014),
       and makes sense conceptually and as a matter of policy.
       <i>
        See In re Tri-River Trading, L.L.C.
       </i>
       , 329
       B.R. 252, 266 (B.A.P. 8th Cir. 2005), aff’d, 452 F.3d 756 (8th Cir. 2006) (“We know of no
       principle of law which suggests that a manager of a company is required to give up agreed upon salary to pay creditors when business turns bad.”). UPA (1997) provides no clawback provision,
       an omission that disadvantaged creditors of an LLP compared to creditors of other entities with a
       liability shield.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Foreign limited liability partnership” and “Foreign partnership” [(5) and (6)]
       </b>
       — These definitions intend a flexible, comparative approach. Under Paragraph 6, if a particular
       type of foreign entity has key legal characteristics that approximate the essential legal
       characteristics of a domestic general partnership, that particular type of foreign entity is a foreign
       partnership under this act. Likewise, under Paragraph 5, if a foreign partnership has a liability
       shield similar to the shield provided under this act for a domestic LLP, the foreign partnership is
       a foreign limited liability partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       As further explained in the comment to Section 306(c), this act provides a full liability
       shield (
    i.e.
    , the shield applies regardless of the law giving rise to a claim against an LLP). A few
       jurisdictions provide only a partial shield.
       <i>
        See, e.g.
       </i>
       ,
       15
       Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 8204 (West 2013)
       (providing the partners of an LLP a shield for claims against the partnership “whether sounding
       in contract or tort or otherwise,” but only the claims that “arise from any negligent or wrongful
       acts or misconduct committed by another partner or other representative of the partnership”). The resulting partial shield does not protect partners against liability for the partnership’s
       ordinary commercial debts, such as liability for lease payments. Nonetheless, a partial-shield
       foreign LLP would be a “foreign limited liability partnership” under Paragraph 6.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Jurisdiction of formation” [(8)]
       </b>
       —This definition” is not limited to United States
       jurisdictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Limited liability partnership” [(9)]
       </b>
       —Under this act (and most, if not all, LLP
       statutes), a general partnership obtains its LLP status from only one jurisdiction. The resulting
       LLP is “domestic” with regard to that jurisdiction and “foreign” with regard to all others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sections 901(f) (cancellation of statement of qualification) and 903 (administrative
       revocation of statement of qualification) limit this paragraph’s open-ended definition of a
       “limited liability partnership” as “a partnership that has filed a statement of qualification under
       Section 901.” Under this act, LLP status depends on a statement of qualification being in effect.
       See Section 903(d) and its comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Partner” [(10)]
       </b>
       —Under Section 202(a), any “person” can be a partner. Paragraph 14 of
       this section defines “person” very broadly to include individuals and “any … legal or
       commercial entity.” At common law, “[t]he general rule … [was] that every person of sound
       mind,
       sui juris
    , and not otherwise restrained by law, may enter into a contract of partnership.”
       Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Law on Partnership § 7, at 10 (2d ed. 1850). The
       phrase “sound mind” and the term “
       <i>
        sui juris
       </i>
       ” suggest that at common law a partner was
       necessarily an individual.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Black’s Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009) (defining
       <i>
        sui juris
       </i>
       as one “[o]f full age and capacity”). UPA (1914) § 2 defined “person” to include “partnerships,
       corporations, and other associations.”
       <i>
        See, e.g., Williams v. Mammoth of Alaska, Inc.
       </i>
       , 890 P.2d
       581, 584 n.8 (Alaska 1995) (stating that under UPA (1914) “[a] partner need not be a natural
       person”).
      </p>
      <p>
       After a person has been dissociated as a partner under Section 602, the term “partner”
       continues to apply to the person’s conduct while a partner.
       See
    Section 603(b).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Partnership” [(11)]
       </b>
       —This definition, combined with Section 202(a), makes clear that a
       general partnership is a
       business
    organization. This definition makes no reference to a
       partnership having partners upon formation, but Section 202(a) does.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Partnership agreement” [(12)]
       </b>
       —This definition must be read in conjunction with
       Sections 105 through 107, which further describe the partnership agreement. In particular,
       although this definition refers to “the agreement … of all the partners,” the partnership itself is
       bound by and may enforce the agreement. Section 106(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       A partnership agreement is a contract, and therefore all statutory language pertaining to
       the partnership agreement must be understood in the context of the law of contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition in Paragraph 12 is very broad and recognizes a wide scope of authority for
       the partnership agreement: “the matters described in Section 105(a).” Those matters include not
       only all relations
       inter se
    the partners and the partnership but also “the business of the
       partnership and the conduct of that business.” Section 105(a)(2). Moreover, the definition puts
       no limits on the form of the partnership agreement. To the contrary, the definition contains the
       phrase “whether oral, implied, in a record, or in any combination thereof.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless the partnership agreement itself provides otherwise:
      </p>
      <p>
       • A partnership agreement may comprise a number of separate documents (or records),
       however denominated; and
      </p>
      <p>
       • Subject to Section 106(b) (deeming new partners to assent to the then-existing
       partnership agreement), a document, record, understanding, etc. can be part of the
       partnership agreement only with the assent of all persons then partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       An agreement among less than all partners might well be enforceable among those
       partners as parties, but would not be part of the partnership agreement. However, under Section
       105(a)(3), an amendment to a partnership agreement can be made with less than unanimous
       consent if the partnership agreement itself so provides.
      </p>
      <p>
       An agreement to form a partnership is not itself a partnership agreement. The term
       “partnership agreement” presupposes “partners,” and a person cannot be a partner in a
       partnership before the partnership exists. However, as soon as a partnership comes into
       existence, it perforce has a partnership agreement. For example, suppose: (i) two persons orally
       and informally agree to join their activities in a manner that satisfies Section 202 (formation of
       partnership); (ii) the partnership is thus formed; and (iii) without further ado or agreement, the
       persons become the partnership’s initial partners. A partnership agreement exists. In the words
       of Paragraph 12 “all the partners” have agreed who the partners are and that, as “all the
       partners,” they will conduct a business. That agreement—no matter how informal or
       rudimentary—is an agreement “concerning the matters described in Section 105(a).” To the
       extent the agreement does not provide the
       inter se
    “rules of the game,” the “default rules” of this act “fill in the gaps.” Section 105(b).
      </p>
      <p>
       This act states no rule as to whether the statute of frauds applies to partnership
       agreements. Case law suggests that the answer is yes:
      </p>
      
      <p>
       Partnership agreements, like other contracts, are subject to the Statute of Frauds. A contract of partnership for a term exceeding one year is within the Statute of Frauds and is void unless it is in writing [and signed by the party to be bound]; however, a contract establishing a partnership terminable at the will of any partner is generally held to be capable of performance by its terms within one year of its making and, therefore, to be outside the Statute of Frauds.

       In contrast, the land provision does not apply to a partner’s interest in a partnership, no
       matter how much the partnership owns or deals in real property. Interests in a partnership are
       personal property and reflect no direct interest in the entity’s assets.
       See
    Sections 102(23), 501.
       Thus, the real property issues pertaining to a partnership ownership of land do not “flow
       through” to the partners and partnership interests.

        “Partnership at will” [(13)]
       </b>
       —This paragraph defines “partnership at will” in the negative (
    i.e.
    , by stating what the defined term is not). A partnership is “at will” if the partners’
       agreement does not obligate them to remain in the partnership until the passage of a specified
       time (a term) or the completion of a specified task, job, project, etc. (an undertaking).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Partnership at will” is thus the default mode under this act; that is, a partnership is “at
       will” unless the partners have agreed otherwise. Absent such agreement, a partner may rightfully
       leave the partnership at any time (dissociate), Sections 601(1), 602(b)(2), and rightfully cause or
       seek the winding up of the partnership and its business (dissolution), Section 801(1);
       see Fleming
       v. Hagen Estate
    , 702 N.W.2d 786, 789 (Minn. Ct. App. 2005) (rejecting “the [appellant] estate’s
       assertion that the district court erred by not concluding that [a partner’s] counterclaim
       unilaterally dissolved the agreement pursuant to [ Minnesota Statutes section 323A.0801]”; noting that “section 323A.0801(1) is applicable only to an at-will partnership”).
      </p>
      <p>
       This act does not directly define “partnership for a term” and “partnership for an
       undertaking,” but their respective meanings are clear from this paragraph’s wording and the case
       law.
       E.g., Girard Bank v. Haley
    , 332 A.2d 443, 447 (Pa. 1975) (“A ‘particular undertaking’ under
       the statute must be capable of accomplishment at some time, although the exact time may be
       unknown and unascertainable at the date of the agreement.”). This paragraph thus suggests that
       a partnership under this act will fit into one of three conveniently labeled categories: at-will, for a
       term, for an undertaking. However, hybrid structures are possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: The partnership agreement of a general partnership:
      </p>
      <p>
       • states a minimum term of ten years;
      </p>
      <p>
       • permits one particular partner to leave the partnership at any time upon thirty days
       advance written notice; and
      </p>
      <p>
       • provides that that person’s dissociation as a partner will neither cause the partnership
       to dissolve nor entitle any other person to dissociate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hybrid structures cause no trouble, if the partnership agreement: (i) clearly and completely
       details the partners’ understanding as to dissociation and dissolution; and (ii) does not confuse
       matters by inaccurately labeling the partnership as if it were a pure form of one of the three
       categories.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Principal office” [(15)]
       </b>
       —This term appears mostly in provisions pertaining to court
       proceedings,
       e.g.
    , Section 809(a), or delivery or service of information;
       <i>
        e.g.
       </i>
       , Sections 117(f)(3),
       912(b). The term also helps determine the governing law for a partnership that is not a limited
       liability partnership. Section 104(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       UPA (1997) referred to a partnership’s “chief executive office,”
       e.g.
    , UPA (1997)
       § 106(a), but did not define the term.
       <i>
        Id.
       </i>
       , cmt. The Harmonization Project substituted “principal
       office,” as a more traditional and better-understood term in business entity statutes. In most
       cases, a partnership’s principal office will be the same as the partnership’s chief executive office
       (however defined). With regard to LLPs and foreign LLPs registered to do business in this state,
       the annual/biennial report will record the LLP’s view on where the LLP’s principal office is
       located.

       <b>
        “Property” [(16)]
       </b>
       —This definition encompasses every form of property. For rules
       determining when property belongs to the partnership, see Section 204.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Transfer” [(22)]
       </b>
       —The term “transfer” is broadly defined to include all types of
       conveyances of interests in property. The reference to “transfer by operation of law” is
       significant in connection with Section 502 (Transfer of Transferable Interest). That section
       severely restricts a transferee’s rights (absent the consent of the partners), and this definition
       makes those restrictions applicable; for example, to transfers ordered by a family court as part of
       a divorce proceeding and transfers resulting from the death of a partner. The restrictions also
       apply to transfers in the context of a partner’s bankruptcy, except to the extent that bankruptcy
       law supersedes this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Transferable interest” [(23)]
       </b>
       —Absent a contrary provision in the partnership
       agreement or the consent of the partners, a “transferable interest” is the only interest in a
       partnership which can be transferred to a non-partner.
       <b>
        See
       </b>
       the comment to Section 502. This act
       does not define any term to encompass the entirety of a partner’s rights in a partnership (
    i.e.
    ,
       governance and information rights as well as economic rights).
      </p>
      <p>
       UPA (1997) took a different approach, defining the entirety of a partner’s rights directly
       and identifying the economic aspect through a limit on transferability.
       See
    UPA (1997)
       §§ 101(9) (defining “[p]artnership interest” or “partner’s interest in the partnership” as “all of a
       partner’s interests in the partnership, including the partner’s transferable interest and all
       management and other rights”), 502 (stating that “the only transferable interest of a partner in the
       partnership is the partner’s share of the profits and losses of the partnership and the partner’s
       right to receive distributions”).
      </p>
      <p>
       This act defines “[t]ransferable interest” as an interest “initially owned by a person in the
       person’s capacity as a partner,” because this act does not contemplate a partnership directly
       creating interests that comprise only economic rights.
       See
    Sections 402 (addressing how a
       person becomes a partner), 503 (addressing how a person becomes a transferee).

        Official Comment.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The Harmonization Project made two important changes to this section. First, unlike UPA
       (1997), this act contains no generally applicable provisions determining when an organization
       other than a partnership is charged with knowledge or notice, because those imputation rules:
       (i) comprise core topics within the law of agency; (ii) are very complicated; (iii) should not have any different content under this act than in other circumstances; and (iv) are the subject of
       considerable attention in the Restatement (Third) of Agency (2006). However, Subsection (e)
       does provide a rule for attributing to a partnership knowledge or notice possessed by a partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, this act does not define “notice” to include “knowledge.” Although
       conceptualizing the latter as giving the former makes logical sense and has a long pedigree, that
       conceptualization is counter-intuitive for the uninitiated. In ordinary usage, notice has a meaning
       separate from knowledge. This act follows ordinary usage and therefore contains some
       references to “knowledge or notice.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —In this context, the most important source of “law other than this
       [act]” is the common law of agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)
       </b>
       —The “facts known to the person at the time in question” include facts
       the person is deemed to know under Subsection (a)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —If a person “notifies” another person of a fact, the other person has
       “reason to know” the fact and therefore has notice under Subsection (b)(1). However, a person
       can have “notice” of a fact without having been “notifie[d]” of the fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 117(f) pertains to delivery of records
    by
    the filing office.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —Following the pioneering approach of UPA (1997), this subsection provides constructive notice of facts stated in specified filed public records. The subsection
       works in conjunction with other sections of this act to curtail the power to bind and personal
       liability of partners and persons dissociated as partners.
       <b>
        See
       </b>
       Sections 702, 703, 804, 805. The
       constructive notice begins ninety days after the effective date of the filed record. For this act’s
       rules on delayed effective dates, see Section 114.
      </p>
      <p>
       UPA (1997) used an oblique and decentralized approach to constructive notice.
       See, e.g.
    , UPA (1997) § 704(c) (stating that “for the purposes of Sections 702(a)(3) [pertaining to the
       lingering power to bind the partnership of a person dissociated as a partner] and 703(b)(3)
       [pertaining to a the lingering liability for partnership obligations of a person dissociated as a
       partner], a person not a partner is deemed to have notice of the dissociation 90 days after [a]
       statement of dissociation is filed”). As revised by the Harmonization Project, this subsection
       provides directly for constructive notice and centralizes all of this act’s constructive notice
       provisions except for those pertaining to statements of authority under Section 303.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —This subsection states the rule for imputing a partner’s knowledge or
       notice to the partnership. The rule was part of the common law.
       Peoples' Bank of Baltimore v.
       Keech
    , 26 Md. 521, 533 (Md. 1867) (holding that “the firm is bound by notice to one of the copartners; because each represents the firm and is general agent of all”). UPA (1914) § 12
       codified the rule, and UPA (1997) § 102(f) carried forward the codified rule with some
       modification. The Harmonization Project did not change UPA (1997) § 102(f), except to delete

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section states two choice-of-law rules: an invariable rule for limited liability
       partnerships, Paragraph 1, and a default rule for non-LLPs, Paragraph 2. Both rules address
       “internal affairs” and “the liability of a partner as a partner for the debts, obligations, or other
       liabilities of the partnership.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Like any other legal concept, “internal affairs” may be indeterminate at its edges.
       However, the concept certainly includes interpretation and enforcement of the partnership
       agreement, relations among the partners as partners, and relations between the partnership and a
       partner as a partner.
       Compare
    Section 104,
       <i>
        with
       </i>
       Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 302, cmt. a (1971) (defining “internal affairs” with reference to a corporation as “the relations
       inter se of the corporation, its shareholders, directors, officers or agents”).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Internal affairs” do not encompass the power
       vel non
    of a person to bind a partnership.
       Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws §§ 292(2) (1971) (“The principal will be held
       bound by the agent's action if he would so be bound under the local law of the state where the
       agent dealt with the third person, provided at least that the principal had authorized the agent to
       act on his behalf in that state or had led the third person reasonably to believe that the agent had
       such authority.”), 295(1) (“Whether a partnership is bound by action taken on its behalf by an
       agent in dealing with a third person is determined by the local law of the state selected by
       application of the rule of § 292.”);
       Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws § 345, cmt. c (1934) (Law Governing Effect of Act of Agent or Partner) (“If … the principal or partner sends
       the agent or other partner into a state to act on his behalf, he assumes the risk of liability not only
       for authorized but for unauthorized conduct of the agent or partner in accordance with the law of
       that state.”);
       <i>
        see also Farm &amp; Ranch Services, Ltd. v. LT Farm &amp; Ranch, L.L.C.
       </i>
       , 779 F. Supp. 2d
       949, 960 (S.D. Iowa 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Internal affairs” and the “liability of a partner as a partner” are mentioned separately,
       because it can be argued that the liability of partners to third parties is not an internal affair.
       See, e.g.
    ,
       Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 307 (1971) (treating shareholders’ liability
       separately from the internal affairs doctrine). A few cases subsume owner/manager liability into
       internal affairs.
       <i>
        See, e.g., Kalb, Voorhis &amp; Co. v. American Fin. Corp.
       </i>
       , 8 F.3d 130, 132 (2d Cir.
       1993) (holding that the corporation’s “primary purpose is to insulate shareholders from legal liability” and therefore “the state of incorporation has the greater interest in determining when
       and if that insulation is to be stripped away” (quoting
       <i>
        Soviet Pan Am Travel Effort v. Travel
        Comm., Inc.
       </i>
       , 756 F. Supp. 126, 131 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, neither “internal affairs” nor the “liability of a partner as a partner”
       encompass a claim that a partner is liable to a third party for: (i) having purported inaccurately to
       have the actual authority to bind a partnership to the third party; or (ii) having committed a tort
       against the third party while acting on the partnership’s behalf or in the course of the
       partnership’s business. That liability is not by status (
    i.e.
    , not “as a partner”) but rather results
       from function or conduct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Treating “liability of a partner as a partner” as a matter of domestic law comports
       generally with the law of business entities. For example, some (if not all) limited liability
       partnership statutes so provide.
       E.g.
    ,
       Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, § 15-1101(a) (2013) (stating that
       “[t]he law under which a foreign limited liability partnership is formed governs … the liability
       of partners for obligations of the partnership”);
       N.Y. P’ship Law § 121-1502(l) (2014) (stating
       that “[t]he laws of the jurisdiction that govern a foreign limited liability partnership shall
       determine … the liability of partners for debts, obligations and liabilities of, or chargeable to, the
       foreign limited liability partnership”).
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, “[t]he general rule [from the case law] is that a plaintiff's alter ego theory is
       governed by the law of the state in which the business at issue is organized.”

       rule).

      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph 1
       </b>
       —The partnership agreement cannot alter this paragraph.
       See
    Section
       105(c)(1). In essence, when a partnership chooses where to deliver for filing a statement of
       qualification, the partnership chooses its governing law. This approach comports with the law of
       other businesses entities whose formation or legal status depends at least in part on a publicly filed record.
       <i>
        See, e.g.
       </i>
       , ULPA (2001) (Last Amended 2013) § 104 (stating that the law of the state
       of formation is the domestic entity’s governing law); ULLCA (2006) (Last Amended 2013) § 104
       (same).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, a partnership agreement may lawfully incorporate by reference the provisions
       of another state’s partnership act. If done correctly, this incorporation makes the foreign
       statutory language part of the partnership agreement, and the incorporated terms (together with
       the rest of the partnership agreement) then govern the partners (and those claiming through the
       partners) to the extent not prohibited by this act.
       See
    Section 105. This approach: (i) does not
       switch the limited liability partnership’s governing law to that of another state; (ii) instead takes
       the provisions of another state’s law and incorporates them by reference into the contract among
       the partners; (iii) raises complex drafting issues –
       <i>
        e.g.
       </i>
       , how to address subsequent changes to the
       incorporated law (whether occurring by statutory amendment or court decision); and (iv) thus is
       rarely, if ever, a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph 2
       </b>
       —Section 102(15) defines “principal office.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement may change the rule stated in this paragraph, although other
       law may limit a partnership’s options.
       See
    Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws §§ 294 (1971) (Relationship of Partners Inter Se), 187(2) (stating the limited bases for
       disregarding a contractual choice of law).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a statement of qualification becomes effective under Section 901: (i) this paragraph
       no longer applies; and (ii) neither the partnership’s principal office nor the partnership agreement
       is relevant to determining the law governing the partnership’s internal affairs. Section 105(c)(1)
       (stating that the partnership agreement may not “vary the law applicable under Section 104(1)”).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The Harmonization Project re-wrote this section, for the most part conforming this section to the corresponding section of ULLCA (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Principal Provisions of the Act Concerning the Partnership Agreement
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement is pivotal to a partnership, and Sections 105 through 107 are pivotal to this act. They must be read together, along with Section 102(12) (defining the partnership agreement).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section performs five essential functions. Subsection (a) establishes the primacy of the partnership agreement in establishing
       inter se
    relations among the partners and partnership. Subsection (b) recognizes this act as comprising mostly default rules (
       <i>
        i.e.
       </i>
       , gap fillers for issues as to which the partnership agreement provides no rule). Subsection (c) lists the few mandatory provisions of the act. Subsection (d) lists some provisions frequently found in partnership agreements, authorizing some unconditionally and others so long as “not manifestly unreasonable.” Subsection (e) delineates in detail both the meaning of “not manifestly unreasonable” and the information relevant to determining a claim that a provision of a partnership agreement is manifestly unreasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 106 details the effect of a partnership agreement on the partnership and on persons becoming partners. Section 107 concerns the effect of a partnership agreement on third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Role and Inevitability of Partnership Agreement
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 102(12) delineates a very broad scope for “partnership agreement.” As a result, once a partnership comes into existence, a partnership agreement necessarily exists.
       See
    the comment to Section 102(12). Accordingly, this act refers to “the partnership agreement” rather than “a partnership agreement.” This phrasing should not, however, be read to require a partnership or its partners to take any formal action to adopt a partnership agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement is the exclusive consensual process for modifying this act’s various default rules pertaining to relationships
       inter se
    the partners and between the partners and the partnership. Section 105(a). The partnership agreement also has power over “the obligations of a partnership and its partners to a person in the person’s capacity as a transferee or person dissociated as a partner.” Section 107(b). For the relationship between the partnership agreement and public records in the filing office, see Section 107(d).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Partnership Agreement and the Fiduciary and Other Duties of Those Who Manage
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most complex questions in the law of unincorporated business organizations is the extent to which an agreement among the organization’s owners can affect the fiduciary and other duties of those who have ultimate power to manage the organization—in a general partnership, the partners themselves. As explained in detail in the comment to Subsection (d)(3), this act rejects the notion that a contract can completely transform an inherently fiduciary relationship into a merely arm’s length association. Within that limitation, however, this section provides substantial power to the partnership agreement to reshape, limit, and eliminate fiduciary and other managerial duties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) recognizes that the partnership agreement is the map to the parties’ deal and that any claim by a partner of managerial misconduct must be assessed first under the relevant terms of the partnership agreement. Subsection (d) specifically validates arrangements commonly used to reshape managerial duties and limit the consequences of breaching those duties. Subsection (c) contains relevant limitations, but those limitations: (i) must be read together with Subsection (d); and (ii) do not preclude the partnership agreement fundamentally redesigning the duties applicable to the partners. For the act’s design of those duties, see Sections 408 and 409.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This section describes the very broad scope of a partnership’s partnership agreement, which includes all matters constituting “internal affairs.”
       Compare
    Section 105(a),
       <i>
        with
       </i>
       Section 104 (using the phrase “internal affairs” in stating a choice of law rule). This broad grant of authority is subject to the restrictions stated in Subsection (c), including the broad restriction stated in Subsection (c)(17) (concerning the rights of third parties under this act).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(1)
       </b>
       —This paragraph encompasses all the rights and duties of each partner, including rights and duties pertaining to transactions under Article 11.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(3)
       </b>
       —Under this provision, the partnership agreement can control both the quantum of consent required (
    e.g.
    , majority of partners) and the means by which the consent is manifested (
       <i>
        e.g.
       </i>
       , prohibiting modifications except when consented to in writing).
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       the comment to Section 107(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the partnership agreement does not address the issue, Section 401(k) applies and requires the affirmative vote or consent of all the partners. Under Section 119 (supplemental principles of law), the parol evidence rule will apply to a written partnership agreement when appropriate under contract law.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —To the extent the partnership agreement does not determine an
       inter se
    matter, this act determines the matter. The partnership agreement may vary any provision of this act pertaining to
       <i>
        inter se
       </i>
       matters, except as provided in Subsections (c) and (d).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes—but not always—the comments to this act refer to a variable provision as a “default rule” and a non-waivable provision as “mandatory.” These references are merely to draw attention to the default/mandatory distinction in particular contexts and have neither the intent nor the power to affect the default/mandatory status of provisions of this act whose comments lack a comparable reference.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This subsection lists provisions of this act whose respective effects cannot be varied or may be varied subject to a stated limitation. For historical reasons, this subsection uses the words “vary” and “alter” interchangeably. No difference in meaning is intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a person claims that a term of the partnership agreement violates this subsection, as a matter of ordinary procedural law the burden of proof is on the person making the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(1)
       </b>
       —“[T]he law applicable under Section 104(1)” establishes the governing law for the internal affairs of a partnership. The organizers of a partnership make this choice of law by choosing to form a partnership under this act. Domestication to another jurisdiction will re-set the choice of law,
       see
    Sections 1151–56, but the partnership agreement cannot.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       the comment to Section 104(1).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) contains no parallel prohibition on varying Section 901 (stating the governing law for foreign limited liability partnerships), because a prohibition is unnecessary. As a matter of fundamental contract law, an agreement among partners of one partnership is powerless to govern the affairs of another partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(3)
       </b>
       —Under this act, a partnership is emphatically an entity, and the partners lack the power to alter that characteristic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cited section pertains to “actions by and against partnership and partners,” arguably comes within Subsection (c)(17) (prohibiting the partnership agreement from “restrict[ing] the rights under this [act] of a person other than a partner”), but is specifically noted for the avoidance of doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(4)
       </b>
       —Although phrased as a restriction, this provision grants substantial power to the partnership agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A law firm operates as a partnership, and the partnership agreement provides that a “Compensation Committee” periodically decides each partner’s compensation. The agreement also states that only partners who are on the Compensation Committee may have access to the Committee’s compensation decisions pertaining to other partners. This restriction is reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The act also empowers the partnership “as a matter within the ordinary course of its business [to] impose reasonable restrictions and conditions on access to and use of information” obtained under Section 408.
       See
    Section 408(j).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether a restriction is reasonable, a court might consider: (i) the danger or other problem the restriction seeks to avoid; (ii) the purpose for which the information is sought; and (iii) whether, in light of both the problem and the purpose, the restriction is reasonably tailored.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(5)
       </b>
       —This limitation is less powerful than might first appear, because Subsection (d) specifically authorizes substantial alterations to the duties of loyalty and care, including restricting and substantially eliminating those duties.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(6)
       </b>
       —Section 409(d) refers to the “contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing,” which contract law implies in every contract. The partnership agreement cannot eliminate this obligation, neither in whole (
    i.e.
    , generally) nor in part (
       <i>
        i.e.
       </i>
       , as applicable to specified situations).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, a partnership agreement may “prescribe the standards … by which the performance of [that] obligation is to be measured.”
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A partnership agreement designates a managing partner, provides that partner almost total control of the partnership’s operations, and grants the partner the discretion to cause the partnership to enter into contracts with affiliates of the partner (so-called “Conflict Transactions”). The agreement further provides: “When causing the Company to enter into a Conflict Transaction, the Managing Partner complies with Section 409(d) of [this act] if a disinterested person, knowledgeable in the subject matter, states in writing that the terms and conditions of the Conflict Transaction are equivalent to the terms and conditions that would be agreed to by persons at arm’s length in comparable circumstances.” This provision “prescribes[s] the standards by which the performance of the [Section 409(d)] obligation is to be measured.”
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Same facts as the previous example, except that, during the performance of a Conflict Transaction, the managing partner causes the partnership to waive material protections under the applicable contract. The standard stated in the previous example is inapposite to this conduct. Section 409(d) therefore applies to the conduct without any direct contractual delineation. (However, other terms of the agreement may be relevant to determining whether the conduct violates Section 409(d).
       See
    the comment to Section 409(d).)
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A partnership agreement designates a managing partner and gives that partner “sole discretion” to make various decisions. The agreement further provides: “Whenever this agreement requires or permits the Managing Partner to make a decision that has the potential to benefit one class of partners to the detriment of another class, the Managing Partner complies with Section 409(d) of [this act] if the Managing Partner makes the decision with:
      </p>
      <p>
       a. the honest belief that the decision:
      </p>
      <p>
       i. serves the best interests of the Partnership; or
      </p>
      <p>
       ii. at least does not injure or otherwise disserve those interests; and
      </p>
      <p>
       b. the reasonable belief that the decision breaches no partner’s rights under this agreement.”
      </p>
      <p>
       This provision “prescribe[s] the standards by which the performance of the [Section 409(d)] obligation is to be measured.”
       Compare
    Section 105(c)(6),
       <i>
        with Nemec v. Shrader
       </i>
       , 991 A.2d 1120 (Del. 2010) (considering such a situation in the context of the right to call preferred stock and deciding by a three-two vote that exercising the call did not breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing).
      </p>
      <p>
       A partnership agreement that seeks to prescribe standards for measuring the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing under Section 409(d) should expressly refer to the obligation.
       See Gerber v. Enter. Prods. Hldgs., L.L.C.
    , 67 A.3d 400, 418 (Del. 2013) (distinguishing between the implied contractual covenant and an express contractual obligation of “good faith” as stated in a limited partnership agreement).
      </p>
      <p>
       For an explanation of the function and role of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, see the comment to Section 409(d). For the rules delimiting the “not manifestly unreasonable” requirement, see Subsection (e).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(7)
       </b>
       —Section 410(b) delineates a partner’s rights to “maintain an action against the partnership or another partner.” It would be unreasonable to frustrate these rights but not unreasonable to channel their exercise. For example, the partnership agreement might select a forum, require pre-suit mediation, provide for arbitration, or require a pre-suit demand on a management committee before a partner files suit against the partnership. Similarly, it is not unreasonable to provide for liquidated damages consonant with the law of contracts. In contrast, it would be unreasonable for a partnership agreement to both: (i) require a partner intending to sue the partnership to make demand on a management committee before filing suit against the partnership regardless of futility; and (ii) bar taking the claim to court no matter how long the management committee ponders the demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(8)
       </b>
       —These restrictions are ubiquitous in the law of business entities and, in conjunction with other provisions of this section, control the otherwise very broad power of a partnership agreement to affect fiduciary and other duties. The restrictions are central to the raft of exculpatory provisions that sprung up in corporate statutes in response to
       Smith v. Van Gorkum
    , 488 A.2d 858 (Del. 1985), overruled on other grounds by
       <i>
        Gantler v. Stephens
       </i>
       , 965 A.2d 695 (Del. 2009). Delaware led the response with
       Delaware Code Annotated title 8, section 102(b)(7), and a number of LLC statutes have similar provisions.
       <i>
        E.g.
       </i>
       ,
       Ga. Code Ann. § 14-11-305(4)(A) (2011). For an extreme example, see
       Virginia Code Annotated section 13.1-1025 (B) (2012). In this context, “conduct” includes both acts and omissions.
       Black’s Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009) (defining conduct as “[p]ersonal behavior, whether by action or inaction”).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “bad faith” has multiple meanings, and the context determines which meaning applies. In the context of the duty of loyalty, “bad faith” includes conduct motivated by ill will or other intent purposely to harm another person. The concept also includes conduct from which a person derives an improper personal benefit.
       See, e.g., Mroz v. Hoaloha Na Eha, Inc.
    , 410 F. Supp. 2d 919, 936–37 (D. Haw. 2005) (denying a motion to dismiss a claim that “the Majority Partners” were personally liable for the partnership’s wrongful termination of the plaintiff; quoting the complaint as alleging that “the Majority Partners, individually and as a group, acted with malice and/or ill will, and/or with an intent to serve their own personal interests and/or without an intent to serve company interests, and/or outside of the scope of their authority and/or without justification”);

      </p>
      <p>
       In the context of the duty of care, the concept of bad faith comes primarily from corporate law and means an extreme breach of the duty (
    i.e.
    , “the failure to exercise “

        honest judgment

       Thus, when a plaintiff alleges bad faith as pertaining to the duty of care, “[t]he burden … is to show irrationality: a plaintiff must demonstrate that no reasonable business person could possibly authorize the action in good faith. Put positively, the decision must go so far beyond the bounds of reasonable business judgment that its only explanation is bad faith.”

       Subsection (c)(8) pertains to indirect as well as direct efforts to “relieve or exonerate” and thus limits how far a partnership agreement can go in providing for indemnification.

       Although this paragraph does not expressly address contracts between a partnership and a partner, the stated constraints must also apply to such contracts. If not, those constraints are effectively meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A general partnership enters into a management contract with its sole managing partner, and the contract provides the partner exoneration for liability to the partnership even for willful and intentional misconduct. Most likely, contract law will treat the provision as against public policy and therefore unenforceable.
       Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 195(1) (1981) (“A term exempting a party from tort liability for harm caused intentionally or recklessly is unenforceable on grounds of public policy.”). If not, a court should hold the provision unenforceable to avoid evisceration of Subsection (c)(8). (Or, the court could invoke the policy expressed in Subsection (c)(8) as grounds for holding the provision unenforceable under contract law.)

      </p>
      <p>
       The second part of the solvency test pertains to preferential rights to distributions, is thus a matter
       inter se
    the partners and any transferees, and is therefore subject to change in the partnership agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, the first part of the solvency test protects third parties—creditors of the partnership—and therefore cannot be changed by the partnership agreement. Section 105(c)(17). Likewise, the partnership agreement cannot change the solvency test stated in Section 406(a)(1) (that “the partnership would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of the partnership’s business”).

       EXAMPLE: ABC Company (“ABC”) has three partners. ABC has two entirely separate lines of business, the Alpha business and the Beta business. Under ABC’s partnership agreement:
      </p>
      <p>
       • Partner 1’s responsibilities pertain exclusively to the Alpha business, while responsibility for:

      </p>
      <p>
       • Partner 2 has no fiduciary duties pertaining to the Alpha business.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elimination of Partner 1’s fiduciary duties with regard to the Beta business and Partner 2’s fiduciary duties with regard to the Alpha business are enforceable, without regard to the “manifestly unreasonable” standard of Subsection (d)(3).

      <p>
       <b>
        Section (d)(3)

       —This act rejects the ultra-contractarian notion that fiduciary duty within a business organization is merely a set of default rules and seeks instead to balance the virtues of “freedom of contract” against the dangers that inescapably exist when some persons have power over the interests of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless, a properly drafted partnership agreement may substantially alter and even eliminate fiduciary duties. Two important limitations exist. First, arrangements subject to this subsection may not be “manifestly unreasonable.”
       See
    Subsection (e) (delineating this standard).
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the partnership agreement may not transform the relationship
       inter se
    partners and the partnership into an entirely arm’s length arrangement. For example, displacement of fiduciary duties is effective only to the extent that the displacement is stated clearly and with particularity. This rule is fundamental in the jurisprudence of fiduciary duty.

It would therefore be manifestly unreasonable for a partnership agreement to negate this rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although Subsection (d)(3) does not expressly address contracts between a partnership and a partner, the stated constraints must also apply to such contracts. If not, those constraints are effectively meaningless.

       EXAMPLE: A general partnership enters into a management contract with its sole managing partner, and the contract provides that the duties of loyalty stated in Section 409(b) are entirely eliminated. If the partnership agreement were to so provide, the provision would be subject to the “manifestly unreasonable standard.” Section 105(d)(3)(A). Absent the authorization provided by Section 105(d)(3)(A), the management contract’s attempt to waive fiduciary duties may be unenforceable as a matter of public policy and contract law.
       See Neubauer v. Goldfarb

Rptr. 2d 218 (2003) (stating that “waiver of corporate directors’ and majority shareholders’ fiduciary duties to minority shareholders in private close corporations is against public policy and a contract provision in a buy-sell agreement purporting to effect such a waiver is void”).

      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection provides rules for applying the concept, specifying:
      </p>
      <p>
       • who decides the issue of “manifestly unreasonable”
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       “the court … as a matter of law,” Subsection (e);
      </p>
      <p>
       • the framework for determining the issue
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       determination to be made “in light of the purposes, activities, and affairs of the partnership,” Subsection (e)(2);
      </p>
      <p>
       • the temporal setting for determining the issue
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR

      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       “[o]nly circumstances existing” when “the challenged term became part of the partnership agreement,” Subsection (e)(1).
      </p>
      <p>
       The subsection also provides a very demanding standard for persons claiming that a term of a partnership agreement is “manifestly unreasonable.” “The court … may invalidate the term only if, in light of the purposes, and business of the partnership, it is
       readily apparent
    that: (A) the objective of the term is unreasonable; or (B) the term is an unreasonable means to achieve the term’s objective.” Subsection (e)(2) (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (e) is fundamental to this act, because: (i) this act generally defers to the agreement among the partners; and (ii) Subsection (e) safeguards the partnership agreement in at least four ways:
      </p>
      <p>
       • Determining manifest unreasonableness
       inter se
    owners of an organization is a different task than doing so in a commercial context, where concepts like “usages of trade” are available to inform the analysis. Each business organization must be understood in its own terms and context.
      </p>
      <p>
       • If loosely applied, the concept of “manifestly unreasonable” would permit a court to rewrite the partners’ agreement, which would destroy the balance this act seeks to establish between freedom of contract and fiduciary duty.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Case law has not adequately delineated the concept.
       See, e.g., In re Brobeck, Phleger &amp; Harrison L.L.P.
    , 408 B.R. 318, 335 (Bankr. N.D. Cal. 2009) (“RUPA [UPA (1997)] does not define what is ‘manifestly unreasonable’ and the parties have not cited, nor can the court locate, a decision that defines the term. Absent case law or even a dictionary definition, the court must rely on its common sense to recognize something as manifestly unreasonable.”).
      </p>
      <p>
       • In the context of statutes permitting stock transfer restrictions unless “manifestly unreasonable,” courts have often ignored the word “manifestly.”
       See, e.g., Brandt v. Somerville,

       —The significance of the phrase “as of the time the term as challenged became part of the partnership agreement” is best shown by example.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: When a particular partnership comes into existence, its business plan is quite unusual and its success depends on the willingness of a particular individual to serve as the partnership’s sole managing partner. This individual has a rare combination of skills, experiences, and contacts, which are particularly appropriate for the partnership’s start-up. In order to induce the individual to accept the position of sole managing partner, the other partners are willing to have the partnership agreement significantly limit the managing partner’s fiduciary duties. Several years later, when the partnership’s operations have turned prosaic and the managing partner’s talents and background are not nearly so crucial, a partner challenges the fiduciary duty limitations as manifestly unreasonable. The relevant time under Subsection (e)(1) is when the partnership began. Subsequent developments are not relevant, except as they might inferentially bear on the circumstances in existence at the relevant time.
      </p>

       EXAMPLE: As initially adopted, a partnership agreement identifies a category of decisions ordinarily subject to the duty of loyalty and provides that “the managing partner’s sole, reasonable discretion” satisfies the duty. A year later, the agreement is amended to delete the word “reasonable.” Later, a partner claims that, without the word “reasonable,” the provision is manifestly unreasonable. The relevant time under Subsection (e)(1) is when the agreement was amended, not when the agreement was initially adopted.

        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection resolves twin questions that have troubled some courts – namely, whether an unincorporated entity that has not signed its foundational agreement nonetheless is bound by and may enforce the agreement. The questions have been particularly troubling in the context of agreements to arbitrate.
       See, e.g., Elkjer v. Scheef &amp; Stone, L.L.P.
    , 3:13-CV-1655-K, 2014 WL 1255844, at *5–6 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 27, 2014) (concluding that a limited liability partnership “is a party to the Partnership Agreement,” even though the partnership itself never signed or otherwise assented to the agreement; enforcing arbitration provision to the benefit of the
       LLP).
       <i>
        Contra Trover v. 419 OCR, Inc.
       </i>
       , 921 N.E.2d 1249, 1255 (2010) (finding that “neither FODG [an LLC] nor the Golf Club [a related LLC] was a party to the operating agreements and that they are therefore not bound by the arbitration clauses therein”).
      </p>
      <p>
       Developments pertaining to the Virginia LLC Act further illustrate the difficulties.
       In
       Mission Residential, L.L.C. v. Triple Net Properties, L.L.C.
    , 654 S.E.2d 888, 891 (Va. 2008), the Virginia Supreme Court held that an LLC member’s derivative claim was not subject to the arbitration provision in the operating agreement, because: (i) the LLC was “the real party in interest”; (ii) the LLC had not signed the operating agreement; and (iii) requiring the claim to be arbitrated would “ignore[] the separate existence of Holdings [the LLC].” The Virginia legislature promptly disagreed and amended the LLC act to state: “A limited liability company is bound by its operating agreement whether or not the limited liability company executes the operating agreement.” 2009
       Va. Acts 763 (S.B. 1241), codified as
       Va. Code Ann. § 13.1-1023.A.1 (2012). The legislature left open the question of a limited liability company’s power to enforce an operating agreement that the company has not executed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection answers the twin questions, categorically and in the affirmative.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection does not consider whether a partnership is an indispensable party to a suit concerning the partnership agreement. That question is one of procedural law, and the answer can determine whether federal diversity jurisdiction exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —Given the possibility of oral and implied-in-fact terms in the partnership agreement, a person becoming a partner of an existing partnership should take precautions to ascertain fully the contents of the partnership agreement.
       See
    Section 105(a)(3), cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>

       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection, derived from
       Delaware Code Annotated title 6, § 18-302(e), permits the partnership agreement to: (i) accord a non-partner veto rights over amendments to the agreement; and (ii) establish other preconditions for amendments. An amendment made in derogation of a veto right or precondition is ineffective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Veto rights are likely to be sought by lenders but may also be attractive to non-partner managers.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A non-partner manager enters into a management contract with a partnership, and that agreement provides in part that the partnership may remove the manager without cause only with the consent of partners holding two-thirds of the profits interests. The partnership agreement contains a parallel provision (the “quantum provision”), but the non-partner manager is not a party to the partnership agreement. Later, the partners amend the quantum provision to reduce the quantum to a simple majority of profits interests and thereafter purport to remove the manager without cause. Although the partnership has undoubtedly breached its contract with the manager and subjected itself to a damage claim, the partnership has the
       power
    under Section 105(a)(2) to effect the removal—unless the partnership agreement provides the manager a veto right over changes in the partnership agreement’s quantum provision.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection does not refer to partner veto rights because, unless otherwise provided in the partnership agreement, the consent of each partner is necessary to effect an amendment.
       See
    Section 401(k).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because “[a] partnership agreement may specify that its amendment requires … the satisfaction of a condition,” a partnership agreement can require that any amendment be made through a writing or a record signed by each partner.
       See
    Section 105(a)(3) (empowering the partnership agreement to determine “the means and conditions for amending the partnership agreement”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —The law of unincorporated business organizations is only beginning to grapple in a modern way with the tension between the rights of an organization’s owners to carry on their activities as they see fit (or have agreed) and the rights of transferees of the organization’s economic interests. If, as is often the situation, the partnership agreement overrides Section 701 (Purchase of Interest of Person Dissociated as Partner), such transferees can include the heirs of the partnership’s founders as well as former partners who, by agreement, are “locked in” as transferees of their own interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the law categorically favors the owners, there is a serious risk of expropriation and other abuse. On the other hand, if the law grants former owners and other transferees the right to seek judicial protection, that specter can “freeze the deal” as of the moment an owner leaves the enterprise or a third party obtains an economic interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is little case law in this area, and almost all of it pertains to limited rather than general partnerships. The case law clearly favors the remaining owners over former owners and other transferees.
       See, e.g., Bauer v. Blomfield Co./Holden Joint Venture
    , 849 P.2d 1365, 1367 n.2 (Alaska 1993) (holding that a mere assignee “was not entitled to complain about a decision made with the consent of all the partners” and stating “[w]e are unwilling to hold that partners owe a duty of good faith and fair dealing to assignees of a partner's interest”);
       <i>
        Bynum v. Frisby
       </i>
       , 311 P.2d 972, 975 (Nev. 1957) (“[A]n assignment of a partnership interest from one partner to a stranger does not bring that stranger into fiduciary relationship with the remaining partners nor require them to resort to dissolution in order to prevent such a relationship from arising. The stranger remains a stranger entitled only to share in the partnership's worth and to demand an accounting upon dissolution.”) (applying UPA (1914) § 27, which pertains to rights of an assignee).

        See generally
       </i>
       Daniel S. Kleinberger,
       <i>
        The Plight of the Bare Naked Assignee
       </i>
       , 42
       Suffolk L. Rev. 587 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection follows
       Bauer
    and other cases by expressly subjecting transferees (including a person dissociated as a partner) to partnership agreement amendments made after the transfer or dissociation, except amendments that increase obligations on transferees. For example, an amendment might extend the duration of a partnership but may not institute a new capital call obligation on transferees.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue of whether, in extreme and sufficiently harsh circumstances, transferees might be able to claim some type of duty or obligation to protect against expropriation awaits development in the case law. An unreported LLC case suggests the answer might be yes, but the decision rests primarily on the wording of the LLC’s operating agreement.
       In
       Kohannim v. Katoli
    , 08-11-00155-CV, 2013 WL 3943078, at *10–11 (Tex. App. July 24, 2013), the court: (i) noted that a limited liability company’s “[r]egulations provide[] for the distribution of ‘available cash’ to members quarterly provided that the available cash is not needed for a reasonable working capital reserve”; (ii) also noted that “Jacob [the defendant member] paid himself $100,000 for management services that were not performed and failed to make any profit distributions to Mike [former member and ex-spouse of the plaintiff Parvaneh] or Parvaneh [ex-spouse of Mike, who became Mike’s transferee as part of their divorce proceeding] even though more than $250,000 in undistributed profit had accumulated in the company’s accounts since the mortgage on the property had been paid off in February 2007”; and (iii) concluded that “more than a scintilla of evidence supports the trial court's finding that Jacob failed to make profit distributions to Pavaneh.” In essence, the court upheld a finding that Jacob had breached (or caused the partnership to breach) a contractual obligation to make distributions. But the court went further: “We also agree with the trial court's conclusion that the established facts 45 demonstrated Jacob engaged in wrongful conduct and exhibited a lack of fair dealing in the company's affairs to the prejudice of Parvaneh.”

      </p>
      <p>
       For the very limited statutory rights of transferees, see Section 503.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)
       </b>
       —This provision is inapposite when “a partner or transferee becomes entitled to receive a distribution.” Section 405(d). In that circumstance:
      </p>
      <p>
       • “the partner or transferee has the status of … a creditor of the partnership with respect to the distribution,”
       id.
    ; and
      </p>
      <p>
       • the relevant obligation is not owed to “a person in the person’s capacity as a transferee or person dissociated as a partner,” Subsection (b), but rather to the person in the person’s capacity as a creditor.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This provision precludes using a filed record (
    e.g.
    , a statement of authority) to make an end run around the strictures of Section 105(c) and (d)(3).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —It will be possible, albeit improvident, for a partnership agreement to be inconsistent with a public filing pertaining to the partnership. For those circumstances, this subsection provides rules for determining which source of information prevails.
      </p>
      <p>
       • For partners and transferees, the partnership agreement is paramount.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Third parties may invoke the public record upon a showing of reasonable reliance, which presupposes actual knowledge –
       i.e.
    , deemed knowledge under Section 103(d) does not suffice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact that a term is present in a publicly filed record and not in the partnership agreement, or
       vice versa
    , does not automatically establish a conflict. This subsection does not expressly cover a situation in which: (i) one of the specified filed records contains information in addition to, but not inconsistent with, the partnership agreement, and (ii) a person, other than a partner or transferee, reasonably relies on the additional information. However, the policy reflected in this subsection seems equally applicable to that situation. Moreover, to argue that the partnership agreement prevails over the filed record is to argue that the additional term does conflict with the partnership agreement, at least in effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 105(a)(3) might also be relevant to the subject matter of this subsection. Absent a contrary provision in the partnership agreement, language in a record delivered to the filing office for filing on behalf of the partnership might be evidence of the partners’ agreement and might thereby constitute or at least imply a term of the partnership agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection does not apply to records delivered to the filing office for filing on behalf of persons other than a partnership.

       Section 105(c)(16)(B) (stating that the partnership agreement may not “vary any requirement, procedure, or other provision of this [act] pertaining to … the [Secretary of State], including provisions pertaining to records authorized or required to be delivered to the [Secretary of State] for filing under this [act]”).
      </p>
      <p>
       The filing office will not check whether a person who purports to be authorized to sign a record on behalf of a partnership actually has that authority, even if a statement of authority pertaining to the matter is in effect. Indeed, even if the filing office somehow “knows” of a statement limiting authority, the office lacks the authority to reject a record on that basis.
       See
    the comment to Section 117(a) (stating the requirements for filing and noting that the filing office’s review is ministerial and limited to information pertaining to the stated requirements), and the comment to Section 117(c) (explaining why such a statement of authority does not affect the filing office).

       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —The filing office will not check the bona fides of a person purporting to have signed a record in a representative capacity. This subsection expressly authorizes taking action through an agent to provide context for Subsection (c) and for the avoidance of doubt. No negative inference should be drawn about using agents to take other action under this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —As a matter of agency law, a person who signs in a representative capacity gives a “warranty of authority.”
       Restatement (Third) of Agency § 6.10 (2006). This subsection has criminal law implications. Under Section 109(c), “[a]n individual who signs a record authorized or required to be filed under this [act] affirms under penalty of perjury that the information stated in the record is accurate.”

        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection relates to liability to third parties for inaccurate information in a filed record. Paragraph 1 requires actual knowledge because the paragraph can inculpate a person who is not a partner. Under Paragraph 2(B), notice suffices, because: (i) the provision applies only to partners; (ii) by status partners have overall management authority; and (iii) therefore, it is reasonable to impose liability when a partner either knows or “has reason to know … from all the facts known to the person at the time in question.” Section 103(b)(1) (defining notice). For the same reason, Paragraph 1 applies only to “information [known] to be inaccurate at the time the record was signed,” while Paragraph 2 applies whenever a “partner knew or had notice of the inaccuracy for a reasonably sufficient time before the information was relied upon so that, before the reliance, the partner reasonably could have [taken corrective action].” Paragraph (2)(B).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —Although this act establishes the avoidance of gross negligence as the standard of care for partners viz-a-viz the partnership, this subsection encompasses liability to third parties. Accordingly, the standard here is more demanding. The phrases “reasonably sufficient time” and “reasonably could have” indicate a standard of ordinary care. “[N]otice of the inaccuracy” involves “reason to know.” Section 103(b)(1).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —Section 105(d)(2) authorizes the partnership agreement to establish an analogous rule
       inter se
    the partners. This subsection goes where the partnership agreement cannot reach and affects the rights of third parties.
      </p>

      <p>
       The filing office’s duty under this section is ministerial, Section 117(a), and the office’s assessment of a record delivered for filing is limited to conformity with this section. The filing office
       must
    file a record delivered for filing if the record contains the information required by this act and is accompanied by the required filing fee. The filing office is authorized to provide forms but not require their use, and, as a result, may not reject records delivered for filing on the basis of form (except to the very limited extent permitted by Subsections (d) and (f)).
      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the very limited discretion granted to the filing office under this section and Section 117(a), “[t]he filing of … a record does not create a presumption that … the information contained in the record is correct … .” Section 117(e).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —The first requisite for having a record filed is to cause the record actually to be received by the filing office. Section 111(b) reiterates this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —A record delivered for filing must be in typewritten or printed form unless the filing office permits delivery by electronic transmission. The types of electronic transmission that may be used will be determined by the filing office and is intended to include the evolving methods of electronic delivery, including facsimile transmissions, electronic transmissions between computers, and filings through delivery of storage media.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(3)
       </b>
       —The text of an entity filing must be in the English language, except to the limited extent permitted by this paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(4)
       </b>
       —To be filed a record must be signed by the appropriate person. See the definition of “sign” in Section 102(20) for a description of the manner in which a record may be “signed.” Who is an appropriate person is determined under Section 108, but the filing office will not check to determine whether a person purportedly authorized to sign is in fact authorized.
       See
    the comment to Section 108(a)–(c).
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement in some state statutes that records delivered for filing on behalf of an entity must be acknowledged or verified as a condition for filing has been rejected. These requirements serve little purpose in connection with entity filings. On the other hand, many organizations, like lenders or title companies, may desire that specific records include acknowledgements, verifications, or seals; Subsection (a)(4) does not prohibit the addition of these forms of execution and their use does not affect the eligibility of the record for filing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —Under this subsection, a confidentiality obligation does not affect the filing office’s duty to file, and the filing office is authorized but not required to redact. This act does not affect any confidentiality-related obligations the filing office may have under other law.

      <p>
       Records accepted for filing become effective at the date and time of filing as recorded by the filing office, or at another specified time on that date, unless a permissible delayed effective date is stated in the record.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 117(b) requires the filing office to maintain some means of recording the date and time of delivery of a record and requires that office to record that date and time as the date and time of filing. That provision gives express statutory authority to the common practice of most filing offices of ignoring processing time and treating a record as filed as of the date and time it is delivered for filing even though it may not be reviewed and accepted for filing until several days after delivery. That section contemplates that time of delivery, as well as the date, will be routinely recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (1)
       </b>
       —In the absence of provision for a delayed effective date, a record delivered for filing becomes effective on the date and time of filing by the filing office. Since under Section 117(b) the date and time of filing is the recorded date and time of delivery of the record to the filing office (which under Section 117(b) is the date and time of actual receipt), together these provisions eliminate any doubt about situations involving same-day transactions in which a record, for example, a statement of merger, is delivered for filing on the morning of the day the merger is to become effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (3)
       </b>
       —This paragraph does not authorize or contemplate the retroactive establishment of an effective date before the date of filing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraphs (3) and (4)
       </b>
       —A record that states an effective date beyond the ninety-day limit is not a record that “satisfies this [act],” Section 117(a), and will properly be rejected by the filing office.

If no delivery is made because of a defect in transmission, a statement of correction may not be used to make a retroactive filing effective.

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —Under this subsection the filing office is required to file a record if it “satisfies this [act].” The purpose of this language is to limit the discretion of the filing office to a ministerial role in reviewing the contents of records. If the record submitted is in the form prescribed, contains the information required by this act, and the appropriate filing fee is tendered, the filing office must file the record. Consistent with this approach, this subsection states explicitly that the filing duty of the filing office is ministerial.
       See
    Subsection (e) (pertaining to presumptions not created).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides that when the filing office files a record, the filing office records it as filed on the date and time of delivery to the filing office, retains the original record for the office’s records, and delivers a copy of the record to the person who delivered the record for filing with an acknowledgement of the date and time of filing. In the case of a statement of denial, Section 304, the filing office will also send a copy of the record and acknowledgment to the partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of a record transmitted electronically to the filing office that office may deliver by electronic transmission. The copy returned will be the exact or conformed copy if the filing office has required one, or will be a copy made by the filing office if an exact or conformed copy was not required.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this subsection the acceptance of a filing is evidenced merely by the filing office’s delivery of a copy of the record with an acknowledgment of the date and time of filing. The act does not provide for the filing office to issue a formal certificate of filing. A copy of the filed record together with an acknowledgment of the date and time of filing should sufficiently indicate that the filing has been accepted for filing and been filed.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —Because of the simplification of formal filing requirements and the limited discretion granted to the filing office by this act, it is probable that rejection of records delivered to the filing office for filing will occur only rarely. This subsection provides that if the filing office does reject a record delivered for filing, the filing office must return the record to the person that submitted the filing within fifteen days together with a brief written explanation of the reason for rejection. In the case of a record delivered by electronic transmission, rejection of the record may be made electronically by the filing office or by a mailing to the person that submitted the record.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides that the filing of a record by the filing office does not affect the validity or invalidity of any provision contained in the record and does not create any presumption with respect to any information in the record. Likewise, the refusal of the filing office to file a record creates no presumption that any of the information in the record is incorrect. Persons adversely affected by a statement in a filed record may contest the statement in a proceeding appropriate for that purpose, including a damage action under Section 109.

      <p>
       Provisions similar to this section have their genesis in
       Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward
    , 17 U.S. (4 Wheat) 518 (1819), which held that the United States Constitution prohibited the application of newly enacted statutes to existing corporations while suggesting the efficacy of a reservation of power similar to this section. This section is a generalized form of the type of provision found in many entity organic laws, the purpose of which is to avoid any possible argument that an entity has contractual or vested rights in any specific statutory provision of its organic law and to ensure that the state may in the future modify its entity statutes as it deems appropriate and require existing entities to comply with the statutes as modified.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section applies to changes in mandatory provisions of this act; the section does not pertain to changes in default rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Having enacted this act, State A later amends Section 402(b)(3) (affirmative vote or consent of all partners required for a person to become a partner) to reduce, as a default rule, the necessary quantum of consent to consent from partners owning in the aggregate at least two-third of the interests in current profits owned by partners at the time of the consent. XYZ is a partnership formed under State A’s act before the amendment. XYZ’s partnership agreement is silent on this issue, leaving in place the act’s default rule. Whether the act’s amended default rule applies depends on whether the partners initially: (i) agreed (whether expressly or implicitly) to accept the then-applicable default rule requiring unanimous consent; (ii) agreed (whether expressly or implicitly) to adopt whatever rule the act provided; or (iii) never considered the issue. In short, the change in a default rule occasions an inquiry into the partners’ express or implied agreement as to the role of the default rule in their mutual understanding. In the first instance, the old rule would continue in effect. In the second and third instances, the new rule would apply.

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —The law of general partnerships long struggled with the question of whether a partnership is merely an aggregate of its partners or an entity distinct from its partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       The common law took the aggregate approach.
    X-L Liquors v. Taylor
    , 111 A.2d 753, 759 (1955) (stating that “the common law did not recognize the separate existence of partnerships”);
       <i>
        Watson v. G.C. Associates Ltd. P'ship
       </i>
       , 691 P.2d 417, 418 (1984) (referring to the “common law or aggregate theory of partnership”);
       <i>
        McKinney v. Truck Ins. Exch.
       </i>
       , 324 S.W.2d 773, 776 (Mo. Ct. App. 1959) (referring to “the aggregate or common-law theory as to partnerships”).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under UPA (1914), a general partnership had both entity and aggregate characteristics, in part because that act’s first reporter, who died during the lengthy drafting process, strongly favored the entity approach, while his replacement just as strongly favored the aggregate construct.
    New England Herald Dev. Grp. v. Town of Falmouth
    , 521 A.2d 693, 697 (Me. 1987) (“The draftsmen of the uniform act were divided over what effect it should have on the common law [aggregate] rule … . The result is the Act contains language that supports application of either [the entity or aggregate] theory.”).
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the comment to this section, UPA (1997) “embrace[d] the entity theory of the partnership,” characterized “the entity theory as the dominant model” for the act, and highlighted a key problem arising from the aggregate aspect of UPA (1914)—namely, “the necessity of a deed to convey title from the ‘old’ partnership to the ‘new’ partnership every time there is a change of cast among the partners.” Under UPA (1997), “there [was] no ‘new’ partnership just because of membership changes,” thereby “avoid[ing] the result in cases such as
    Fairway Development Co. v. Title Insurance Co.
    , 621 F. Supp. 120 (N.D. Ohio 1985), which held that the ‘new’ partnership resulting from a partner’s death did not have standing to enforce a title insurance policy issued to the ‘old’ partnership.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The Harmonization process made no changes to this aspect of UPA (1997). Note, however, that UPA (1997) retained several aspects of the aggregate construct: (i) joint and several liability of the partners for the obligations of a partnership that is not an LLP, Section 306(a); (ii) the concept of a partnership at-will, under which dissociation of any partner by “express will” dissolves the partnership, Section 801(1); and (iii) the susceptibility to dissolution of a partnership for a term or undertaking following the dissociation of a person as a partner. Section 801(2). Those vestiges continue under the Harmonization amendments adopted in 2011 and 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —Neither becoming nor ceasing to be a limited liability partnership affects a partnership’s entity status. These changes merely add or subtract a characteristic.
    Compare
    Section 201(b),
       <i>
        with
       </i>
       Section 1146(a)(1) (stating that “[w]hen a conversion becomes effective [] (1) the converted entity is: (A) organized under and subject to the organic law of the converted entity [and therefore a different type of entity]; and (B) the same entity without interruption as the converting entity”).

       UPA (1997) § 202 combined UPA (1914) §§ 6 and 7, recasting the “definition” of a partnership in UPA (1914) § 6(1) “as an operative rule of law –
       i.e.
    , “[a] partnership is an association of two or more persons . …” became “the association of two or more persons… forms.” The change was stylistic and made no substantive change in the law. The Harmonization Project made no substantive change to this section, except to clarify that this act is not linked to the uniform limited partnership act.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Subsection (b), cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The addition of the phrase, “whether or not the persons intend to form a partnership,” merely codifies the universal judicial construction of UPA (1914) § 6(1) that a partnership is created by the association of persons whose intent is to carry on as co-owners a business for profit, regardless of their subjective intention to be “partners.” Indeed, they may inadvertently create a partnership despite their expressed subjective intention not to do so. The language of Section 202 alerts readers to this possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —Consistent with the common law and UPA (1914), under this act “co-ownership” is a key concept. Ownership involves the power of ultimate control (albeit a power that can be substantially diminished by agreement) and a right to share in the profits of the co-owned business. To state that partners are co-owners of a business is to state that: (i) they share in the profits (if any) of the enterprise; and (ii)
       ab initio
    at least, they collectively have the power of ultimate control. Consequently:
      </p>
      <p>
       • mere passive co-ownership of property, as distinguished from using the property to carry on a business, does not establish a partnership, Subsection (c)(1); and
      </p>
      <p>
       • merely sharing gross revenues is likewise insufficient, Subsection (c)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       UPA (1997) added, “whether or not the persons intend to form a partnership” to the UPA (1914) formulation, thereby codifying a rule uniformly applied by courts: Subjective intent to create the legal relationship of “partnership” is irrelevant. What matters is the intent
       vel non
    to establish the business relationship that the law labels a “partnership.” Thus, a disclaimer of partnership status is ineffective to the extent the parties’ intended arrangements meet the criteria stated in this subsection.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection continues the UPA (1914) concept that the general partnership is the residual form of business association. Accordingly, partnership-like organizations formed under specially applicable statutes are not within this act.
       E.g.
    ,
       Mont. Code Ann. §§ 35-13-101 to
       102 (pertaining to mining partnerships).
      </p>
      <p>
       An arrangement labeled a “joint venture” is a partnership if the arrangement meets the criteria stated in Subsection (a). In fact, in many jurisdictions, the law of general partnerships applies almost without analysis to joint ventures in which the co-venturers share profits.
       See Jonathan Woodner Co. v. Laufer
    , 531 A.2d 280, 285 n.7 (D.C. 1987) (stating that: (i) “[s]trictly speaking, a joint venture is not the same as a partnership, but there is ‘very little law … applicable to one that does not apply to the other’”; (ii) “the rights and liabilities of joint venturers among themselves are generally governed by the laws of partnership”; and (iii) “[p]rinciples of partnership law, in particular the Uniform Partnership act, apply in most instances to joint ventures”) (quoting 46
       Am. Jur. 2d Joint Ventures § 4, at 25 (1969) and collecting cases).
      </p>
      <p>
       A limited partnership is not a partnership under this act; a limited partnership is “formed under a statute other than this [act]” (
    i.e.
    , ULPA (2001) (Last Amended 2013) § 201). Moreover, ULPA (2001) delinked the uniform limited partnership act from the uniform general partnership act.
       <i>

       </i>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       An unincorporated nonprofit organization is not a partnership under this act, because the organization is limited to “nonprofit purposes” and therefore cannot “carry on a business” in the traditional sense of that concept.
       See
    UUNA (2008) (Last Amended 2013) § 102(11) (defining “unincorporated nonprofit association”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —UPA (1997) derived this subsection from UPA (1914) § 7 and with one exception, made no substantive change to the law. The substantive change pertains to the sharing of profits, which UPA (1997) recast as creating a rebuttable presumption of partnership rather merely constituting
       prima facie
    evidence. “
       <i>
        Prima facie
       </i>
       ” means that the party with the burden of proof has adduced sufficient evidence to carry that burden, subject to the finder of fact’s view of any contrary evidence. The burden of persuasion is unchanged. In contrast, “rebuttable presumption” switches the burden of persuasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(3)
       </b>
       —The protected categories listed in this paragraph apply regardless of whether the profit share is a single, unvarying percentage or a ratio that varies; for example, after reaching a dollar floor or different levels of profits. Like UPA (1914), this act makes no attempt to answer in every case whether a partnership is formed. Whether a relationship is more properly characterized as that of borrower and lender, employer and employee, or landlord and tenant is left to the trier of fact. As under UPA (1914), a person may function in both partner and non-partner capacities.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(3)(E)
       </b>
       —UPA (1997) added this protected category, excepting from the rebuttable presumption a share of the profits received in payment of interest or other charges on a loan, “including a direct or indirect present or future ownership in the collateral, or rights to income, proceeds, or increase in value derived from the collateral.” The quoted language was taken from Section 211 of the Uniform Land Security Interest Act and is intended to protect shared-appreciation mortgages, contingent or other variable or performance-related mortgages, and other equity participation arrangements by clarifying that contingent payments do not presumptively convert lending arrangements into partnerships.

       Although phrased differently, this section, which originated in UPA (1997), produces the same result as do UPA (1914) §§ 8(1) and 25. All property acquired by a partnership, by whatever manner acquired, becomes partnership property and belongs to the partnership as an entity, rather than to the individual partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 204 provides guidance concerning when property is “acquired by” the partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       UPA (1914) § 25(2)(c) and (e) also provides that partnership property is not subject to exemptions, allowances, or rights of a partner’s spouse, heirs, or next of kin. UPA (1997) omitted those provisions as unnecessary, because the exemptions and rights inure to the property of the partners, and not to partnership property.

      <p>
       Section 204 states the rules
       inter se the partners and partnership
    for determining when property is acquired by the partnership and so becomes partnership property. These rules apply to “all property, whether real, personal, or mixed or tangible or intangible, or any right or interest therein.” Section 102(16) (defining “property”).
      </p>
      <p>
       These rules provide three separate approaches—according to:
      </p>
      <p>
       • the name or names used in acquiring the property;
      </p>
      <p>
       • when a partner’s name appears as a transferee, the capacity in which the partner is acting; and
      </p>
      <p>
       • for property acquired by purchase, whether the partnership provided the consideration for the property.
      </p>
      <p>
       These approaches are complementary, not mutually exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section omits any provision corresponding to UPA (1914) § 8(4), which states: “A conveyance to a partnership in the partnership name, even without words of inheritance, passes the entire estate of the grantor unless a contrary intent appears.” UPA (1997) omitted the provision as unnecessary because under modern conveyancing law all transfers pass the entire estate or interest of the grantor unless a contrary intent appears.
      </p>
      <p>
       To what extent this section’s
       inter se
    rules affect third party rights is a matter for other law, but in any event these rules yield automatically to statutes providing record title for particular types of property. For an example, see Subsection (c), comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a) and (b)
       </b>
       —These subsections act in combination to provide the first two of the approaches listed above. Under these subsections, property becomes partnership property if acquired:
      </p>
      <p>
       • in the name of the partnership; or
      </p>
      <p>
       • in the name of one or more of the partners with an indication in the instrument transferring title of either:
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       their capacity as partners; or
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       of the existence of a partnership, even if the name of the partnership is not indicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Property acquired “in the name of the partnership” includes property acquired in the name of one or more partners in their capacity as partners, but only if the name of the partnership is indicated in the instrument transferring title.
      </p>
      <p>
       Property transferred to a partner is partnership property, even though the name of the partnership is not indicated, if the instrument transferring title indicates either: (i) the partner’s capacity as a partner; or (ii) the existence of a partnership. This approach is consonant with the entity theory of partnership and resolves the troublesome issue of a conveyance to fewer than all the partners but that nevertheless indicates their partner status.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsections (c) and (d)
       </b>
       —At least
       inter se
    the partners and partnership, it is the intention of the partners that controls whether property belongs to the partnership or to one or more of the partners in their individual capacities. These subsections each contain a rebuttable presumption as to the partners’ intent.
      </p>
      <p>
       When applicable, the presumptions switch the burden of persuasion but are subject to an important limitation in favor of third parties.
       See
    Section 302(a)(3) (“Partnership property held in the name of one or more persons other than the partnership, without an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed signed by the persons in whose name the property is held.”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —Under this subsection, property purchased with partnership property is presumed to be partnership property, notwithstanding the name in which title is held or any other indicia. In this context, a promise made by a partnership in exchange for property triggers the presumption, including a promise to perform services or to guarantee another person’s obligation with regard to the purchase of the property.
      </p>
      <p>
       The presumption is entirely ineffective against third parties with regard to property with record title.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Using partnership funds, a partner purchases realty in the partner’s own name and records the purchase in the appropriate land records. The partner later transfers title to the realty to a third party that has neither knowledge nor notice of any rights the partnership may have in the property. The relevant real estate statute is the applicable law; this subsection is entirely inapposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —Under this subsection, property acquired in the name of one or more of the partners, without an indication of their capacity as partners and without use of partnership funds or credit, is presumed to be the partners’ separate property, even if used for partnership purposes. In effect, this subsection presumes that only the use of the property is contributed to the partnership.

      <p>
       At common law, a general partner was considered a general agent of the partnership. Joseph Story,
       Commentaries on the Law on Partnership § 101, at 153 (2d ed. 1850);
       Restatement (Second) of Agency § 14A, cmt. a (1958). The mere status of a general partner “clothes” a person with apparent authority to carry on the partnership business.

    , 80 U.S. 531, 567 (1871);

       </i>
       , 659 N.E.2d 731, 733, 740 (Mass. 1996). In 1914, the UPA codified this principle, UPA (1914) § 9, and “statutory apparent authority” has been part of uniform partnerships acts ever since.

       UPA (1997) § 301 (1997) (Partnership Agent of Partnership); ULPA (2001) § 402 (General Partner Agent of Limited Partnership).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section’s principal purpose is to delineate a partner’s statutory apparent authority. The partnership agreement and Section 401 govern the rights of the partners among themselves, including the right to restrict a partner’s actual authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Section 301(1)
       </b>
       —This paragraph retains the basic principles reflected in UPA (1914) § 9(1) and in effect characterizes a partner as a general managerial agent. Such agents have both actual and apparent authority, and this section delineates the apparent authority. For a discussion of the scope of actual authority, see Section 401(h), comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The agency law origins of statutory apparent authority has informed courts’ application of UPA (1914) § 9(1), and that case law is equally applicable under this act. For example, although the statutory language does not appear to require that the appearance of authority be reasonable, the case law does so routinely.
       See, e.g., In re Fox Hill Office Invs., Ltd.
    , 101 B.R. 1007, 1019 (Bankr. W.D. Mo. 1989) (stating a third-party lender in possession of a copy of a limited partnership’s partnership agreement was on notice of the general partner’s lack of authority and therefore should have inquired as to the partner’s authority),
       <i>
        aff'd
       </i>
       ,
       926 F.2d 752 (8th Cir. 1991);
       <i>
        Investors Title Ins. Co. v. Herzig
       </i>
       , 360 S.E.2d 786, 789 (N.C. 1987) (stating that “in order to hold the [partnership] liable, [a third party] must show that in the exercise of reasonable care under the circumstances, it was justified in believing that the principal had conferred . . . authority to [act] on behalf of the partnership”);
       <i>
        First Interstate Bank of Oregon, N.A. v. Bergendahl
       </i>
       , 723 P.2d 1005, 1010 (Or. Ct. App. 1986) (stating that bank in possession of management agreement was on notice of general partner’s restricted authority and could not rely on a theory of apparent authority).
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, per the law of apparent authority, a partner can bind a partnership under this section even if the partner intends to take and does take the resulting benefits for the partner’s own benefit.
       See Wolfe v. Harms
    , 413 S.W.2d 204, 216 (Mo. 1967) (stating that partnership is liable for partner’s acts “even if the predominant motive of the partner was to benefit himself or third persons”);
       <i>
        Rouse v. Pollard
       </i>
       , 18 A.2d 5, 7 (N.J. Eq. 1941) (“All the partners are responsible for the act of one of their number as agent, even though he acts for some secret purpose of his own, and not really for the benefit of the [partnership].”),
       <i>
        aff'd
       </i>
       ,
       21 A.2d 801 (N.J. Eq. 1941);
       <i>
        Investors Title Ins. Co. v. Herzig
       </i>
       , 360 S.E.2d 786, 788 (N.C. 1987) (stating that the mere fact that the partner’s act was for personal gain was not enough to justify summary judgment for the partnership on the subject of the partnership’s liability for the act).
      </p>
      <p>
       UPA (1997) § 301(1) effected three changes from UPA (1914) § 9(1). First, Section 301(1) clarified that a partner’s apparent authority includes acts for carrying on in the ordinary course “business of the kind carried on by the partnership,” not just the business of the particular partnership in question. UPA (1914) is ambiguous on this point, but the drafters of UPA (1997) found some authority for an expanded construction in accordance with the so-called English rule.
       See, e.g., Burns v. Gonzalez
    , 439 S.W.2d 128, 131 (Tex. Civ. App. 1969) (dictum);
       <i>
        Comm’l Hotel v. Weeks
       </i>
       , 254 S.W. 521 (Tex. Civ. App. 1923).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Harmonization Project preserved this UPA (1997) change, the significance of which depends on how broadly courts construe “business of the kind carried on by the partnership.” For example, does a partnership that acts as a grain broker (never taking a position in grain) do business “of the kind carried on” by a partnership that buys grain for resale?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, UPA (1997) used “carrying on in the ordinary course” in lieu of the UPA (1914) phrase “in the usual way.” The 1997 comments stated that: (i) “[t]he UPA and the case law use both terms without apparent distinction”; and (ii) “[n]o substantive change [was] intended by use of the more customary phrase.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The change in language had the benefit of aligning Section 301(1) with Section 305 (establishing attribution rules for a partner’s wrongful conduct and referring to “ordinary course of business of the partnership” and “the ordinary course of the partnership’s business”). The Harmonization Project also preserved this UPA (1997) change. For a discussion of the relationship between the ordinary course of the partnership’s business and a partner’s ordinary duties, see Section 305(a), comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       UPA (1997)’s third change to UPA (1914) § 9(1) concerned the allocation of risk of a partner’s lack of authority. Under UPA (1914) § 9(1) and (4), a restriction on a partner’s authority binds only a person with knowledge of the restriction. In contrast, UPA (1997) § 301(1) provides that a person who has received a notification of a restriction is also bound. Thus, UPA (1997) shifted the risk of lack of authority somewhat away from the partnership and somewhat toward third parties dealing with partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Harmonization Project shifted the risk a bit further, binding third parties who know or
       have reason to know
    of a restriction. Section 301(1). (However, it is arguable that the Harmonization Project merely made explicit a rule implicit in the case law. As noted above, the case law requires a third party to show a
       <i>
        reasonable
       </i>
       belief in the partner’s authority. A third party who has reason to know of a partner’s lack of authority will be hard pressed to make that showing.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Statements of partnership authority, Section 303, affect the application of this paragraph only in two ways. First, under Section 303(e) all persons (other than partners) are deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner to transfer real property contained in a statement recorded in the appropriate land records. Second, a person (other than a partner) with actual knowledge of a grant or limitation of a partner’s authority may rely on that knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Section 301(2)
       </b>
       —UPA (1997) drew this paragraph directly from UPA (1914) § 9(2), with conforming changes to mirror the new language of Paragraph (1). Consistent with the law of agency, a partnership is bound by a partner’s actual authority, even if the partner lacks apparent authority. Under general agency principles, a partnership can subsequently ratify a partner’s unauthorized act.
       See
    Section 119.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        UPA (1914) § 9(3) and (4)
       </b>
       —UPA (1997) omitted UPA (1914) § 9(3), which lists five acts requiring unanimous consent of the partners to bind the partnership. Most of the listed acts probably remain outside the apparent authority of a partner under this act, such as disposing of 70 the goodwill of the business, but the drafters of UPA (1997) believed that eliminating categorical rules affords useful flexibility. In particular, it seemed “archaic to always require unanimous consent to submit a partnership claim to arbitration.” UPA (1997) § 301, cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       UPA (1914) § 9(4) provides that a partnership is not bound by an act of a partner in contravention of a restriction on a partner’s authority known to the other party. UPA (1997) omitted that provision as being entirely redundant of UPA (1997) § 301(1).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Harmonization Project preserved UPA (1997)’s approach to both UPA (1914) § 9(3) and (4).

      </h4>
      <p>
       UPA (1997) § 302 replaced UPA (1914) § 10 and provides rules for the transfer and recovery of partnership property. While UPA (1914) § 10 covers only real property, this section applies also to personal property acquired by instrument and held in the name of the partnership or one or more of the partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       The language of this section was adapted in part from the Georgia partnership statute in effect during the UPA (1997) drafting process.
       See
    Ga. Code Ann. § 14-8-10. Rules stated in this section necessarily parallel the rules stated in Section 203.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —Subsection (a)(1) deals with the transfer of partnership property held in the name of the partnership and Subsection (a)(2) deals with property held in the name of one or more of the partners with an indication either of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership. Subsection (a)(3) deals with partnership property held in the name of one or more of the partners without an indication of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership. Like Section 301, Subsection (a)(1) is subject to statements of partnership authority under Section 303.
       See
    the comment to Section 301(1).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection deals with the right of a partnership to recover partnership property transferred by a partner without actual authority. The subsection's structure corresponds to the structure of Subsection (a).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)
       </b>
       —This paragraph deals with the recovery of “property transferred under subsection (a)(1) [or] (2).”
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(2)
       </b>
       —This paragraph deals with the recovery of “property transferred under subsection (a)(3).”
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —UPA (1997) added this subsection, which parallels Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, section 8(a) (subsequent transferee from bona fide purchaser protected), 8(b)(2) (same).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —UPA (1997) added this subsection. So that this provision does not destroy transferee rights, “all the partners interests” must be read to mean “each interest that originated as a partner interest—which includes all transferable interests, by whomever owned.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The UPA (1997) comment to this subsection took a noteworthy position on the consequences of all the partners’ interests in the partnership being held by one person:
      </p>
      
      <p>
       Subsection (d) allows for clear record title, even though the partnership no longer exists as a technical matter. When a partnership becomes a sole proprietorship by reason of the dissociation of all but one of the partners, title vests in the remaining “partner,” although there is no “transfer” of the property. The remaining “partner” may execute a deed or other transfer of record in the name of the non-existent partnership to evidence vesting of the property in that person’s individual capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Click to view
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 801(6), added during the Harmonization Project, changes the analysis. The paragraph states that dissolution is caused by “the passage of 90 consecutive days during which the partnership does not have at least two partners.” Consequently, for at least eighty-nine consecutive days a partnership remains un-dissolved although having only one partner, and even at ninety days the partnership remains a partnership, albeit dissolved and compelled to wind up its business. Subsection (d) remains quite useful if the sole remaining partner winds up the partnership by becoming a sole proprietor, but it is no longer accurate to state that a partnership with only one partner “no longer exists as a technical matter.”

      <p>
       UPA (1997) § 303 pioneered this concept, which was refined in ULLCA (2006) and further refined in the Harmonization Project. This section is conceptually divided into two realms: (i) statements pertaining to the power to transfer interests in the partnership real property; and (ii) statements pertaining to other matters. In the latter realm, statements are filed only in the records of the filing office and operate only to the extent the statements are actually known and relied on by a third party. Section 303(d), (e).
      </p>
      <p>
       As to interests in real property, in contrast, this section: (i) requires double filing—with the filing office and in the appropriate land records; and (ii) provides for constructive knowledge of statements limiting authority. Thus, a properly filed and recorded statement can protect the partnership, Section 303(g), and, in order for a statement pertaining to real property to be a sword in the hands of a third party, the statement must have been both filed and properly recorded, Section 303(f). Experience suggests that statements of authority will most often be used in connection with transactions in real estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       By its terms, this section applies only to domestic general partnerships. The section refers throughout to “partnership,” which means a domestic general partnership.
       See
    Section 102(11) (“‘Partnership’ … means an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit formed under this [act] or that becomes subject to this [act] under [Article] 11 [mergers and other organic transactions] or Section 110 [transition provision that eventually makes pre-existing general partnerships subject to this act].”).

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —This paragraph permits a statement to designate authority by position (or office) rather than by specific person, thus avoiding the need to file anew whenever a new person assumes the position or the office. This type of a statement will enable partnerships to provide evidence of ongoing power to enter into transactions without having to disclose to third parties the entirety of the partnership agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here and elsewhere in the section, the phrase “real property” includes all types of interests in real property, such as mortgages, easements, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)(A) and (a)(3)(A)
       </b>
       —The authority to “sign” an instrument includes the authority to commit the partnership to the transfer reflected in the agreement.
       See
    Subsection (f) (referring not merely to signing but also to “an effective statement of authority that grants authority to transfer real property”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This subsection expresses a very important limitation –
       i.e.
    , that this section’s rules do not operate viz-a-viz partners. For partners, the partnership agreement is controlling. Section 107(d). However, like any other record delivered for filing on behalf of a partnership, a statement of authority might be some evidence of the contents of the partnership agreement.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       the comment to Section 107(d).
      </p>
      <p>
       Another important limitation exists. The filing office is not affected by a statement of authority that purports to delineate the authority of persons to sign documents to be delivered for filing of behalf of a partnership. The act does define “[p]erson” to include a “government or governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality,” Section 102(14), but “a limitation on the authority of a person or a position contained in an effective statement of authority is not by itself evidence of knowledge or notice of the limitation by any person,” Subsection (d).
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, even if an employee of the filing office happened to see that a statement of authority purported to delineate the authority of persons to sign records to be delivered on behalf of a partnership, that information would not pertain to a “fact [that] is material to the agent's duties to the principal” and therefore would not be attributed to the filing office.
       Restatement (Third) of Agency § 5.03 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —The phrase “by itself” is important, because the existence of a limitation of authority could be evidence if, for example, the person in question reviewed the public record at a time when the limitation was of record.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)(2)
       </b>
       —This paragraph by its terms does not affect a claim of lingering apparent authority. A person could: (i) assert knowledge of a statement of authority as the statement existed before a cancellation or restrictive amendment; and (ii) characterize the original statement as a manifestation of authority traceable to the partnership.
       Restatement (Third) of Agency § 3.03, cmt. b (2006) (“Apparent authority is present only when a third party's belief is traceable to manifestations of the principal.”).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, for apparent authority to exist, the purported agent must
       reasonably
    appear to be authorized.
       Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.03 (2006) (stating that apparent authority can only exist when “a third party reasonably believes the actor has authority to act on behalf of the principal”). Given the possibility of cancellation or restrictive amendment, how reasonable can it be for a person to know of a statement of authority, let time pass, and then rely on the statement without re-checking the public record?
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsections (f)–(h)
       </b>
       —These subsections: (i) pertain to transactions in real property; (ii) provide a mechanism by which authority to transfer a partnership’s real property can be made to appear in the real estate records; and (iii) thus address the principal concerns (raised by real estate lawyers) that led the drafters of UPA (1997) to provide for statements of authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides a sword for a vendee of real property. If the vendee has “give[n] value in reliance on the grant without knowledge to the contrary,” the statement of authority protects the vendee against claims that contradict the grant.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f)(1) and (2)
       </b>
       —As to a claim of lingering apparent authority, see Section (e)(2), comment. The analysis stated there applies even more strongly in the context of customary practices involving land transfers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (g)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides a shield for the partnership as alleged vendor. If a vendee’s claim contradicts the stated limitation, constructive notice knowledge (“deemed to know”) defeats the claim even if the vendee gave value and lacked actual knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (h)
       </b>
       —This subsection integrates statements of dissolution, Section 802(b)(2)(A), and termination, Section 802(b)(2)(F), into the operation of this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effect of a statement of dissolution depends on the circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: ABC, a general partnership, has in effect a properly filed and recorded statement of authority authorizing ABC’s CEO to transfer real estate owned by the partnership. The proper filing and recording by ABC of a statement of dissolution cancels the statement of authority. Subsequently, Buyer gives value in return for a deed signed by the CEO on behalf of ABC. Due to Subsections (h) and (f)(1), Subsection (f) does not protect Buyer. Moreover, under Subsections (g) and (h), Buyer is “deemed to know” of the dissolution. Whether that deemed knowledge functions to deprive the CEO of authority to bind ABC depends on agency law and additional facts. For example, the CEO might have had actual or apparent authority to transfer the real estate despite the dissolution of the partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, the effect of a statement of termination, Section 802(b)(2)(f), is categorical. If properly filed with the filing office and properly recorded in the office for land records, the statement eliminates the power of any person to transfer real property owned in the name of the partnership. No one can have the authority to act for a non-existent entity.
       Cf.
    Restatement (Third) of Agency § 4.04(1)(a) (2006) (precluding ratification by a principal that did not exist at the time of the unauthorized act).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (i)
       </b>
       —This provision permits a partnership to use statements of authority during winding up. As an additional protection for third parties, a statement must be “designated as a post-dissolution statement of authority” to be effective under this provision.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (k)
       </b>
       —Presumably, when real property is involved, a person who obtains the filing of a statement of denial under Section 304 will cause a certified copy of the statement to be “recorded by certified copy for purposes of subsection (f)(1)” [undercutting constructive notice as to authority to transfer real property]. However, nothing in this subsection prevents the partnership from causing a certified copy to appear in the land records; due the section’s use of the passive voice (“may be recorded”), the act does not delimit who has the authority to act under this subsection.

       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This provision is derived from UPA (1914) § 13 (Partnership Bound by Partner’s Wrongful Act), as modernized by UPA (1997) § 305(a) (Partnership Liable for Partner’s Actionable Conduct) and for the most part parallels the agency law doctrine of
       respondeat superior
    .
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Restatement (Second) of Agency § 14A, cmt. a (1958) (“When one of the partners is in active management of the business or is otherwise regularly employed in the business, he is a servant of the partnership.”). The liability is vicarious and without regard to the fault of those managing the partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       UPA (1997) expanded this attribution rule in two ways. First, the 1997 language omitted the 1914 phrase “not being a partner in the partnership,” thereby permitting a partner to sue the partnership under this subsection during the term of the partnership, rather than being limited to the remedies of dissolution and an accounting. This change was consistent with UPA (1997) § 410(b) (stating “[a] partner may maintain an action against the partnership or another partner, with or without an accounting as to partnership business, to enforce the partner’s rights and protect the partner’s interests”). Second, adding “or other actionable conduct” broadens the subsection to cover no-fault torts.
      </p>
      <p>
       To successfully invoke this provision, a plaintiff must show: (i) “a wrongful act or omission or other actionable conduct” by a partner; (ii) that caused “loss or injury”; and (iii) that at the relevant moment, the partner was acting with actual authority, apparent authority (if relevant), or within “the ordinary course of business of the partnership.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Extrapolating from agency law, apparent authority is relevant only when the appearance of authority augments the impact of the wrongful act.
       See
    Restatement (Third) of Agency, § 7.08 (2006) (“A principal is subject to vicarious liability for a tort committed by an agent in dealing or communicating with a third party on or purportedly on behalf of the principal when actions taken by the agent with apparent authority constitute the tort or enable the agent to conceal its commission.”).
      </p>
      <p>
       An act or omission may be “in the ordinary course of business of the partnership” even though the act is wrongful. Any other interpretation would vitiate the “ordinary course” element. “The proper question … is not whether the specific wrongful act is ‘ordinary course’ …, but rather whether that type of act, if done rightfully, would be.”
       Daniel S. Kleinberger, Agency, Partnership and LLCs: Examples and Explanations § 10.5.1, at 350 (4th ed. 2012) (emphasis omitted
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in
       Jackson v. Jackson
    , 201 S.E.2d 722, 724 (N.C. App. 1974), the North Carolina Court of Appeals stated that, while “[a]dvising the initiation of a criminal prosecution is clearly within the normal range of activities for a typical law partnership, … taking such action maliciously and without probable cause is quite a different matter.” The court held that “[i]n view of [ethics] rules, which clearly forbid any attempt by a lawyer to prosecute a person without cause, it cannot be held that malicious prosecution is within the ordinary course of business of a law partnership.”
       <i>
        Id.
       </i>
       It is difficult to identify a reasonable limit to this approach. Presumably, at least, a partner's “plain vanilla” malpractice is within a law firm’s ordinary course of business despite the ethical rules requiring lawyers to act zealously and competently.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, Subsection (a) refers to “the ordinary course of business of the
       partnership
    ” (emphasis added); thus, the proper question is whether the conduct is in the ordinary course for the partnership and not whether the particular partner ordinarily plays a role in that part of the partnership’s business.

        Subsection (b)

       —This provision is derived from UPA (1914) § 14 (Partnership Bound by Partner’s Breach of Trust) and UPA (1997) § 305(b) (Partnership Liable for Partner’s Actionable Conduct). It is not necessary that the partner “receiv[ing] or caus[ing] the partnership to receive money or property” do so wrongfully. Culpability is necessary at the second phase—
    i.e.
    when “the money or property is misapplied by a partner.”

      <p>
       <b>
        Derivation
       </b>
       —This section was derived from UPA (1997) § 306, which was also the source for ULPA (2001) § 404 and ULLCA (2006) § 304. The Harmonization Project brought the two partnership acts and the limited liability company act into accord to the extent the three acts overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —Until the advent of limited liability partnerships and limited liability limited partnerships, one hallmark of general partner status was strict, vicarious liability for the debts, obligations, and other liabilities of the partnership. This subsection states that venerable rule, albeit with two changes:
      </p>
      <p>
       • Under UPA (1914) § 15, the nature of the general partners’ liability depended on the claim, giving rise to the partnership’s liability. If the partnership’s liability sounded in tort, the general partners’ liability was joint and several. If the partnership’s liability sounded in contract, the general partners’ liability was only several. UPA (1997) § 306(a) dispensed with that distinction.
      </p>
      <p>
       • UPA (1997) § 307(d) generally requires a judgment creditor to exhaust the partnership’s assets before enforcing a judgment against the separate assets of a partner. Prior law was to the contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Harmonization Project made no substantive changes to this subsection.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —UPA (1997) continued the approach of UPA (1914) §§ 17 and 41(7) to the vicarious liability of an incoming partner, but used a simpler and clearer formulation. The Harmonization Project made no substantive changes to this subsection.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regard to when a partnership incurs a debt, obligation, or other liability, the case law is scant and concerns only contractual and similar obligations. The leading case is
       Conklin Farm v. Leibowitz
    , 658 A.2d 1257 (N.J. 1995), which holds that: (i) obligations on a loan, whether for interest or principal, are incurred when the loan is made, not when each particular payment is due; and (ii) obligations for lease payments are incurred when each rental payment is due, not when the lease is made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conklin
    concerned a partnership loan obligation that was: (i) entered into before a particular partner joined the partnership; but (ii) for the most part, was payable afterwards. The court held that “interest is part of the contractual debt, and the obligation to pay interest on a loan
       <i>
        arises
       </i>
       , if at all, at the time that the parties execute the note or other debt instrument.
       <i>
        Conklin
       </i>
       ,
       658 A.2d at 1261. The court indicated that the same analysis applies to the obligation to repay principal.
       <i>
        Id.
       </i>
       at 1263 (stating that “the decisive issue before this court … [is that] [p]ayment of interest, like repayment of advances, is an obligation that arises at the time the debt instrument is executed”).
      </p>
      <p>
       Conklin
    discussed the lease issue in response to the creditor's argument that “just as a rent obligation arises for current use of property, an interest obligation arises for current use of principal.”
       <i>
        Id.
       </i>
       at 1261. Rejecting that argument, the court: (i) noted “the
       <i>
        common-law
       </i>
       obligation to pay rent based on current tenancy [which] … arises with each period of tenancy, and … arises even in the absence of a lease”; (ii) described “the common-law obligation to pay rent [as] entirely independent of the contractual obligation under the lease”; and (iii) held that, for purposes of partnership law, the rule for “incurring” a lease obligation rests on the common law duty in tenancy and not on the lease as a contract.
       <i>
        Id.
       </i>
       at 1262 (citing
       <i>
        Ellingson v. Walsh, O'Connor &amp; Barneson
       </i>
       , 104 P.2d 507, 508 (Cal. 1940)).
      </p>
      <p>
       As to when a partnership incurs a tort liability, the answer might be found by analogy to statute of limitation rules, another area of law concerned with when claims arise. “Although the courts have not been consistent … , the interpretation of [when] a … statute [of limitations begins to run] as applied to torts has been such that the statute does not usually begin to run until the tort is complete … . A tort is ordinarily not complete until there has been an invasion of a legally protected interest of the plaintiff.”
       Restatement (Second) of Torts § 899, cmt c (1979);
       see also Loehr v. Ventura Cnty. Cmty. Coll. Dist.
    , 147 Cal. App. 3d 1071, 1078 (Cal. Ct. App. 1983). By analogy, a partnership would incur liability for a tort when the harm occurs.
       <i>
        See, e.g., Jones v. Cox
       </i>
       , 828 P.2d 218, 224 (Colo. 1992) (“A cause of action has commonly been understood to ‘accrue’ when a suit may be maintained thereon.”) (quoting
       Black’s Law Dictionary 19 (5th ed. 1979));
       <i>
        Loehr
       </i>
       ,
       147 Cal. App. 3d at 1078.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, a policy argument exists to the contrary. Vicarious liability for a partnership's torts should be confined to persons who are partners when the wrongful conduct occurs. It is the conduct, not the consequences, that is wrongful; therefore, the occurrence of the wrongful conduct should determine which set of partners is liable for the conduct's consequences.
      </p>
      <p>

       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides a corporate/LLC-like liability shield for partners, protecting them from (and only from) the debts, obligations and liabilities of the partnership –
       i.e.
    , against a partner’s alleged vicarious liability for the obligations of the entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Full Liability Shield
      </p>
      <p>
       This act provides a full liability shield –
       i.e.
    , the shield applies regardless of the law giving rise to a claim against an LLP. A few jurisdictions provide only a partial shield.
       <i>
        See, e.g.
       </i>
       ,
       15
       Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 8204 (West 2013) (providing the partners of an LLP a shield for claims against the partnership “whether sounding in contract or tort or otherwise,” but only the claims that “arise from any negligent or wrongful acts or misconduct committed by another partner or other representative of the partnership”). The resulting partial shield does not protect partners against liability for the partnership’s ordinary commercial debts, such as liability for lease payments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shield Applicable Regardless of the Identity of the Plaintiff
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes the shield relevant is the nature of the claim. If the complaint seeks to hold a partner vicariously liability for the LLP’s obligations, the shield applies. If not, not. Thus, there is no distinction among a claim arising from an LLP’s debt to a commercial creditor, a partner’s claim that the LLP has failed to return a contribution as required by the partnership agreement, and a claim by a former partner that the LLP has failed to follow through on a buy-out agreement.
       See Rappaport v. Gelfand
    , 197 Cal. App. 4th 1213, 1230–32 (Cal. Ct. App. 2011) (involving a claim by a former partner).

      </p>
      <p>
       Shield Inapposite for Claims Arising from a Partner’s Own Conduct
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the partner liability at issue is solely vicarious, the LLP shield is irrelevant to claims seeking to hold a partner directly liable on account of the partner’s own conduct. Case law on this issue comes from the analogous context of limited liability companies, and in that context a few judges have failed to understand this point.
       See
    ULLCA (2006) (Last Amended 2013) § 304(c), cmt. (Shield Inapposite for Claims Arising from a Member’s or Manager’s Own Conduct). However, the overwhelming weight of case law is contrary, as are the actual words of shield provisions (immunizing only for obligations of the entity and making no reference to direct obligations of an owner or manager) and public policy (which recoils from the idea of immunizing a person’s misconduct solely because the person acts on behalf of an organization).
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A partner personally guarantees a debt of a limited liability partnership. Subsection (c) is irrelevant to the partner’s liability as guarantor.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A partner purports to bind a limited liability partnership while lacking any agency law power to do so. The LLP is not bound, but the partner is liable for having breached the “warranty of authority” (an agency law doctrine). Subsection (c) does not apply. The liability is not
       for
    a debt, obligation, or other liability of the LLP, but is rather the partner’s own, direct liability. Indeed, the liability exists because the LLP is
       <i>
        not
       </i>
       indebted, obligated or liable.
       Restatement (Third) of Agency § 6.10 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A partner of a limited liability partnership defames a third party in circumstances that render an LLP vicariously liable under Section 305(a). Under Subsection (c), the third party cannot hold the partner accountable for the
       partnership’s
    liability, but that protection is immaterial. The partner is the tortfeasor and in that role is directly liable to the third party.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A limited liability partnership provides professional services, and one of its partners commits malpractice. The liability shield is irrelevant to the partner’s direct liability in tort. However, if the partner’s malpractice liability is attributed to the partnership under Section 305(a), the liability shield will protect the other partners against a claim that they must make good on the LLP’s liability. The same analysis applies if the plaintiff also successfully claims that another partner was negligent in supervising the first partner
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A limited liability partnership with two partners enters into a contract to build a home, and the partners perform substantial amounts of the work. The homeowner sues both the LLP and the partners for allegedly defective work, but the complaint sounds in contract rather than in tort. The LLP may be liable, but the partners are not.
       See Ogea v. Merritt
    , 130 So. 3d 888, 905 (La. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) pertains only to claims based on the LLP’s liability and is irrelevant to claims by a limited liability partnership or a partner against another partner and
       vice versa
    .
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Sections 307 (pertaining to actions by partners), 409 (pertaining to management duties).
      </p>
      <p>
       Shield Inapposite to Role Liability Claims
      </p>
      <p>
       Provisions of regulatory law may impose liability on a partner of an LLP due to a role the partner plays in the partnership.
       See, e.g., Food Team Intern., Ltd. v. Unilink, L.L.C.
    , 872 F. Supp. 2d 405, 424 (E.D Pa. 2012) (holding several individuals “subject to secondary individual liability under PACA [Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act]” because their roles within a limited liability company enabled them to control the relevant assets) (citing
       <i>
        Bear Mountain Orchards, Inc. v. Mich–Kim, Inc.
       </i>
       , 623 F.3d 163, 172 (3d Cir. 2010)). Subsection (c) does not affect this “role liability.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The Temporal Nexus—When Claim Incurred
      </p>
      <p>
       The LLP shield functions only with respect to obligations incurred while the partnership
       is a limited liability partnership. The shield does not protect partners from vicarious liability for
       partnership obligations incurred before a partnership becomes an LLP or after the partnership
       cancels its LLP status.
       See
    Section 903(d). The same is true initially when LLP status has been
       administratively revoked, but reinstatement of LLP status resurrects the shield retroactively,
       except as to persons who relied on the revocation. Section 903(d).
      </p>
      <p>
       For a preliminary discussion of when a partnership obligation is incurred, see Subsection
       (b), comment. It could well be argued that “incurred” under Subsection (c) has the same meaning
       as “incurred” under Subsection (b).
       IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez
    , 546 U.S. 21, 34 (2005) (referring to "the
       normal rule of statutory interpretation that identical words used in different parts of the same
       statute are generally presumed to have the same meaning");
       <i>
        Timberline Air Serv., Inc. v. Bell
        Helicopter-Textron, Inc.
       </i>
       , 884 P.2d 920, 925 (1994) (stating that “[w]hen the same words are used
       in different parts of the same statute, it is presumed that the Legislature intended that the words
       have the same meaning”).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the argument should yield if the subsections’ different contexts raise different
       issues of policy.
       1a Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction § 45:12 (7th ed.) (stating that “departure from the literal construction of a statute is justified when such a
       construction would produce an absurd and unjust result and would clearly be inconsistent with
       the purposes and policies of the act in question”);
       see, e.g., S.V. v. R.V.
    , 933 S.W.2d 1, 4 (Tex.
       1996) (“[W]e have held that a cause of action accrues when a wrongful act causes some legal
       injury, even if the fact of injury is not discovered until later, and even if all resulting damages
       have not yet occurred. We have not applied this rule without exception, however, and have sometimes held that an action does not accrue until the plaintiff knew or in the exercise of
       reasonable diligence should have known of the wrongful act and resulting injury.”) (citations
       omitted).
      </p>
      <p>
       The case law concerning contractual obligations (incurred when the contract is made)
       applies appropriately in the context of the LLP shield. However, the lease case law is
       problematic. If an obligation is incurred each time rent is due, subsection(c) is a trap for the
       unwary landlord.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Ordinary general partnership enters into a lease with a commercial landlord.
       Knowing that each partner is automatically liable for the partnership's debt, the landlord
       does not obtain personal guarantees. Subsequently, the partnership becomes an LLP. If
       future rent payments are incurred when due, and not as of when the lease was made, the
       landlord loses a very important part of the bargain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, for the purposes of Subsection (c), lease obligations should be treated as contractual
       obligations, incurred when the contract is made.
      </p>
      <p>
       A similar issue exists with regard to tort liability. Courts must look to when the conduct
       causing the injury takes place and not to when actual injury occurs. Otherwise, a partnership
       could: (i) engage in wrongful conduct that does not cause immediate injury; (ii) come to realize
       that the conduct has occurred; (iii) subsequently file a statement of qualification; (iv) thereby become an LLP; and (v) thereby eliminate the vicarious liability of its partners for all harm
       subsequently arising from the misconduct.
       Cf. Savini v. Univ. of Haw.
    , 153 P.3d 1144, 1150
       (Haw. 2007) (addressing the question of when a statute of limitations begins to run for bodily
       injury, when another statute precludes bringing a claim until the amount of damages has reached a specified threshold).
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, courts should determine the “incurred” question under Subsection (c) so that
       the LLP shield protects the partners of an LLP to the same extent that the corporate and LLC
       shields protect corporate shareholders and LLC members. From that perspective, LLP status
       obtained after a partnership commits a wrongful act should provide no greater protection for the
       partners than a sole proprietor obtains by forming an LLC after committing a wrongful –
       i.e.
    ,
       none.
       <i>
        See, e.g., Foxchase, L.L.L.P. v. Cliatt
       </i>
       , 562 S.E.2d 221, 224 (Ga. Ct. App. 2002) (holding
       that a partnership’s liability shield did not protect partners from claims of property damage
       caused by the construction of a golf course, where the jury could have found that the “damage … occurred when they, not the partnership, owned the course”).
      </p>
      <p>
       From the same perspective,
       Evanston Ins. Co. v. Dillard Dept. Stores, Inc.
    , 602 F.3d 610
       (5th Cir. 2010) makes no sense. Interpreting the Texas LLP statute, the court held that a partner’s
       liability for a partnership debit is incurred only when judgment is entered against the partnership.
       Although the decision itself benefitted creditors, the holding invites the type of gamesmanship
       shown in the leasing example, above. Moreover, the decision: (i) has been criticized by the
       Texas
       Court of Appeals,
       <i>
        Am. Star Energy &amp; Minerals Corp. v. Stowers
       </i>
       , 405 S.W.3d 905, 907 (Tex.
       App. 2013); (ii) ignores the precedent discussed in Subsection (b), comment and Section 307(c),
       comment; and (iii) can be distinguished as depending on the particular (non-uniform) language of the Texas statute.

      <p>
       Effect of LLP Status on Relations Inter Se the Partners
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the most noticeable consequence of LLP status is the corporate/LLC-like
       liability shield, there are two
       inter se
    consequences as well. One is straightforward; the other is complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       • When a partnership chooses the jurisdiction in which to deliver for filing a statement of
       qualification, the partnership chooses its governing law. Section 104(1). The partnership
       agreement cannot override that choice. Section 105(c)(1).
      </p>
      <p>
       • When a partnership becomes a limited liability partnership, several related default rules
       change (going forward):
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       Partners no longer share losses. Capital losses “lay where they fall.”
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       Except for contributions promised but not made, partners no longer have
       contribution obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       Due to:
      </p>
      <p>
       • the liability shield, partners are no longer required to contribute
       capital to enable the partnership to meet its obligations to creditors;
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       • the elimination of loss sharing, partners are no longer required to
       contribute capital to adjust capital losses
       inter se
    .
      </p>
      <p>
       In this context, a partnership’s obligations include a duty to indemnify partners (and others).
       Thus, indemnification provisions (whether as provided by this act, Section 401(c), or the
       partnership agreement) are no longer “backstopped” by the partners.
       See
    the comment to
       Subsection (c)(1).

        Subsection (c)(1)
       </b>
       —The main part of Subsection (c) overrides contribution obligations
       under this act. Paragraph 1 overrides contribution obligations created by the partnership
       agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: The partnership agreement of a non-LLP partnership requires partners to
       contribute additional capital as necessary to fund the partnership’s obligations to
       indemnify partners. When the partnership becomes an LLP, Paragraph 1 overrides that
       requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph 1 does not, however, override contribution and indemnification requirements
       running directly from partner to partner. These obligations are not obligations of the LLP but
       rather personal to each partner. If such obligations remain in the partnership agreement, they
       might disable the shield as to partnership liability arising from the misconduct of a partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: The partnership agreement of a non-LLP partnership requires partners to
       contribute additional capital as necessary to fund the partnership’s obligations to
       indemnify the Managing Partner and also states:
      </p>
      <p>
       To the extent the partnership lacks sufficient funds to perform the partnership’s
       88 indemnification obligation, each partner shall indemnify the Managing Partner to
       the same extent and under the same conditions as the partnership. As among
       themselves, the indemnifying partners shall share the indemnification obligation
       proportional to their rights to distributions of then current profits as of the time the
       Managing Partner’s conduct gave rise to the claim for which the Managing
       Partner is to be indemnified.
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership becomes an LLP. Subsequently, the Managing Partner is held liable in
       tort for conduct within the scope of the Managing Partner’s responsibility and the
       partnership is held liable under Section 305(a). The partnership has no funds to pay the
       judgment or indemnify the Managing Partner. Paragraph 1 overrides the contribution
       requirement but does not change each partner’s obligation to indemnify the Managing
       Partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Managing Partner’s right to be indemnified is an asset of the Managing Partner, and
       the judgment creditor can levy on that asset, thereby defeating the liability shield in effect
       if not in form.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(2)
       </b>
       —
    The Shield and Dissolution.
    The rule stated here is inherent in the
       nature of partnership dissolution. “[D]issolution does not end a partnership’s existence but rather
       changes the purpose of that existence.” Section 801, cmt. “A dissolved partnership shall wind up
       its business and … continues after dissolution … for the purpose of winding up.” Section 802(a).
       Put another way: dissolution and winding up are part of the life cycle of a partnership – sometimes the most complicated part. There is no logical reason to remove the shield during the
       last part of an LLP’s life cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection makes this point expressly, because it is possible to misinterpret some
       outlying cases as holding to the contrary.
       See, e.g., Carolina Cas. Ins. Co. v. L.M. Ross Law Grp.,
       LLP
    , 151 Cal. Rptr. 3d 628, 635 (2012) (affirming the trial court’s decision to hold an LLP’s
       named partner liable for a judgment against his limited ability partnership; noting that “[c]entral
       to the decision to amend the judgment to add Ross [the named partner] as a judgment debtor … is the trial court's finding that Ross Law Group dissolved”; recognizing, however, that, before the
       partnership incurred the liability, Ross had signed and filed with the California Secretary of State
       a form stating that the law firm had “cease[d] to be a registered limited liability partnership and
       is hereby filing this notice with the California Secretary of State that [it] is no longer a registered
       limited partnership”) (quotation marks omitted).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Shield and Termination.
    This subsection does not expressly provide that, when a
       limited liability partnership’s existence terminates, the LLP shield remains in place as to any
       debt, obligation, or other liability of the partnership incurred before the termination. However,
       the point follows ineluctably from Subsection 306(a). That subsection adopts an “occurrence”
       rather than a “claims made” basis for determining whether the shield applies.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       the comment
       to Subsection (b). (The Temporal Nexus –When Claim Incurred).
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, any other result would: (i) create huge holes in the shield; (ii) put the law of
       unincorporated businesses at odds with the law of corporations; (iii) render surplus this act’s
       distribution recapture provision, Section 407; (iv) render meaningless the exception to the notice
       requirement as stated in Sections 807(b)(5) and 808(b)(4); and (v) render nonsensical the
       otherwise logical extension of the equitable trust fund theory to limited liability partnerships.
       Cf. Velasquez v. Franz
    , 589 A.2d 143, 146 (N.J. 1991) (explaining that “the trust-fund doctrine … renders shareholders who receive distributed assets of the corporation liable as ‘trustees’ for
       claims of the corporation's creditors”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —This subsection was added during the Harmonization Project and
       pertains to the equitable doctrine of “piercing the veil” –
       i.e.
    , conflating an entity and its owners
       to hold one liable for the obligations of the other. The doctrine of “piercing the corporate veil” is
       well established, and courts should apply the doctrine to limited liability partnerships for the same reasons that courts have regularly (and sometimes almost reflexively) applied the doctrine
       to limited liability companies.
       <i>
        Cf. Axtmann v. Chillemi
       </i>
       , 740 N.W.2d 838, 847 (N.D. 2007)
       (stating that “the shield of a limited liability partnership may be pierced under ‘the case law that
       states the conditions and circumstances under which the corporate veil or limited liability shield
       of a corporation may be pierced under North Dakota law … .’”) (quoting N.D.C.C. § 45-22-09(1)).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, as with LLC piercing, LLP piercing involves one important distinction from
       the corporate realm. While under corporate law “disregard of corporate formalities” is a key
       piercing factor, that factor is inapposite in the law of unincorporated organizations. Corporate
       formalities reflect statutory mandates. LLP formalities derive for the most part from the
       agreement among the partners. From a policy perspective, disregarding formalities adopted by
       agreement differs substantially from disregarding formalities imposed by law.
       See e.g. In re
       Packer
    , Bankruptcy No. 13–41304, 2014 WL 5100095 (Bankr. E.D. Tex. Oct. 10, 2014) (noting the informality of LLC governance, recognizing that “the disregard of corporate formalities …
       [is] one of the key factors in [corporate] veil-piercing determinations”; but holding that “‘it
       makes no sense to imperil the shield simply because the members do not undergo meaningless
       formalities such as formal meetings’”) (citing Carter G. Bishop &amp; Daniel S. Kleinberger,
       Limited Liability Companies: Tax And Business Law ¶ 6.0 3 at *3 (Thomson Reuters Tax
       and Accounting 2014)).
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, because the terms of a partnership agreement may be “implied,” Section
       102(12), an LLP’s ongoing disregard of formalities may well constitute an amendment to the
       partnership agreement. If so, disregard equals amendment, and the concept of “disregard of
       formalities” makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, this subsection is inapposite to another key piercing factor – disregard of the
       separateness between entity and owner.
       Cf. Vanderford Co. v. Knudson
    , 165 P.3d 261, 271 (Idaho
       2007) (noting that managing member and “his accountant testified that the LLC's checking
       account was so confusing that the accountant could not be sure whose money was in the account
       at what times”);
       <i>
        Utzler v. Braca
       </i>
       , 972 A.2d 743 (Conn. App. Ct. 2009) (holding that veil piercing
       was appropriate under alter-ego theory when owner deposited LLC funds into a commingled
       bank account from which he made withdrawals for personal needs and unrelated projects).
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A partner in a limited liability partnership uses a car titled in the
       partnership’s name for personal purposes and writes checks on the partnership’s account
       to pay for personal expenses. These facts are relevant to a piercing claim; they pertain to
       economic separateness, not Subsection (b) formalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection addresses claims to “impos[e] liability on a partner for a debt, obligation,
       90 or other liability of the partnership” –
       i.e.
    , for what is sometimes termed a “direct pierce.”
       Whether the same approach should apply to claims for a “reverse pierce” is a question for the
       courts.
       <i>
        See Comm'r of Envtl. Prot. v. State Five Indus. Park, Inc.
       </i>
       , 37 A.3d 724, 732–33 (Conn.
       2012) (stating that “[a]lthough some courts have adopted reverse veil piercing with little
       distinction as a logical corollary of traditional veil piercing, because the two share the same
       equitable goals, others wisely have recognized important differences between them”).
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection is inapposite to a member’s claim that the disregard of agreed-upon
       formalities is a breach of the partnership agreement.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Section 307 reflects the entity construct, Section 201(a), was new in UPA (1997), and
       cannot be varied by the partnership agreement.
       See
    Section 105(c)(3). The Harmonization
       Project made no substantive changes to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —UPA (1997) § 307 clarified and simplified an “entity versus aggregate”
       question that had been at best complicated under the common law and UPA (1914) (
    i.e.
    , whether
       a general partnership could sue and be sued in its own name and without joining all the partners).
      </p>
      <p>
       “[A]t common law, … a partnership could neither sue or be sued in its name. The
       individual partners were required to be named as plaintiffs in an action brought by the
       partnership and as defendants in an action against a partnership.”
       Telamarketing Commc'ns, Inc.
       v. Liberty Partners
    , 798 S.W.2d 462, 463 (Ky. 1990) (discussing Kentucky law);
       <i>
        see also
       </i>
       Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Law on Partnership § 241, at 373–74 (2d ed. 1850) (“It is a
       general rule, that in all such suits at law [between a partnership and a third party] all the partners
       should join.”).
      </p>
      <p>
       UPA (1914) was silent on the point, although some courts inferred capacity to sue (and
       presumably to be sued) from other entity-like characteristics reflected in that act.
       E.g., Decker
       Coal Co. v. Commonwealth Edison Co.
    , 714 P.2d 155, 157 (Mont. 1986) (agreeing with a party’s
       contention that “[a]lthough … the UPA does not expressly deal with the question of a
       partnership’s capacity to sue, … the UPA does show the modern tendency to treat a partnership
       as a legal entity distinct from and independent of the individuals composing it”; citing as an
       example, a partnership’s ability to “own property in its own name”; and holding that “it is clear
       that a partnership is indeed a legal entity distinct from its partners [and] [t]herefore, … has the
       capacity to sue in its own name”).
      </p>
      <p>
       The situation was further complicated by “common name” statutes enacted in many
       states.
       See Silliman v. DuPont
    , 302 A.2d 327, 331 (Del. Super. 1972), aff'd sub nom.,
       <i>
        F. I. Du
        Pont, Glore Forgan &amp; Co. v. Silliman
       </i>
       , 310 A.2d 128 (Del. 1973) (“The basic purpose of
       [common name] statutes was to permit a non-corporate entity to be sued in the name it presented
       to the public without the necessity of joining the many individuals who composed it.”).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule stated here is perhaps implicit in Section 201(a) (“A partnership is an entity
       distinct from its partners.”). It is a hallmark of a legal entity that it can sue and be sued. In any
       event, this subsection leaves no room for doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —The phrase “not inconsistent with Section 306” means:
      </p>
      <p>
       • If a debt, obligation, or other liability is incurred by a limited liability partnership,
       this subsection does not permit joinder of a partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Likewise, if a debt, obligation, or other liability is incurred by an ordinary
       partnership before a person becomes a partner, this subsection does not permit
       joinder of that person.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for when a claim is incurred, see Section 307(c) and (d), comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reference to “not inconsistent with Section 306” is the procedural analog to the
       substantive protections of Section 306(b) (incoming partner not liable for pre-existing
       partnership obligations) and (c) (partners not liable for partnership obligations incurred by an
       LLP). When a partner has personally guaranteed a partnership obligation, naming that partner in
       a suit against the partnership is “not inconsistent with Section 306.”

       306(c) (Shield Inapposite for Claims Arising from a Partner’s Conduct);

        Subsection (c)

       —Reflecting the entity construct, Section 201(a), this subsection provides

       partners; and (ii) cannot be satisfied from a partner’s personal assets absent a judgment against
       the partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       As did UPA (1914) and UPA (1997), this act leaves to the law of judgments to determine
       the collateral effects to be accorded a prior judgment for or against the partnership in a
       subsequent action against a partner individually.

      <p>
       This subsection and Subsection (d) combine to create a trap for the unwary. For statute of
       limitations purposes, a creditor’s claim against the partners accrues simultaneously with the
       claim against the partnership. If a creditor chooses not to sue the partners in its suit against the
       partnership, the statute of limitations may run before the creditor commences suit against the
       partners.

      <p>
       UPA (1997) § 308 continued the basic principles of partnership by estoppel stated in UPA
       (1914) § 16. To the extent a partnership liability results under Section 308, Section 307 applies.
       See
    Section 307(e). The Harmonization Project made no substantive changes to this section.

        Subsections (a) and (b)
       </b>
       —Even though these subdivisions refer to “reliance” without
       expressly imposing a reasonableness requirement, the requirement exists in the case law.
       See, e.g., In re Cay Clubs
    , 319 P.3d 625, 633 (Nev. 2014) (adopting the requirement and stating that,
       although the requirement is not explicitly stated in [the statute,] [g]enerally, jurisdictions provide that the partnership-by-estoppel doctrine conditions liability on the plaintiff having reasonably
       relied on the representation of partnership, which often involves an exercise of due diligence to

       Like UPA (1914) § 16, this section imposes no duty of denial; thus, a person held out by
       another as a partner is not liable without having actually consented to the representation.

        Official Comment.

      </h4>
      <p>
       For the most part, Section 401 merely restates the rules of UPA (1914) § 18, thereby establishing many of the default rules that govern the relations among partners. All of these rules are, however, subject to contrary agreement of the partners as provided in Sections 105 through 107.
      </p>
      <p>
       UPA (1997) § 401(a) experimented with providing a default configuration for capital accounts. For the reasons stated in Section 405, comment, the Harmonization Project ended the experiment and eliminated the configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection continues the approach of UPA (1914) § 18(a), although for the reasons stated in Section 405, comment, the Harmonization Project substituted “distribution” for “profits.” Distributions are shared equally and losses are shared in proportion to each partner’s share of distributions. Thus, under this default rule, partners share distributions per capita and not in proportion to capital contribution (per capital).
      </p>
      <p>
       If partners agree to share distributions other than equally, losses will be shared in the same proportion as distributions, absent agreement to do otherwise. This rule, carried over from UPA (1914) rests on the assumption that partners would likely agree to share losses on the same basis as distributions, but may fail to say so. Of course, by agreement, they may share losses on a different basis from distributions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subject to contrary agreement and the effect of Section 806(e), this subsection’s loss sharing rules apply, even where one or more of the partners contribute no capital. The rule was the same under UPA (1914) § 18(a), although there is some case law to the contrary.
       See, e.g., Kovacik v. Reed
    , 315 P.2d 314 (Cal. 1957);
       <i>
        Becker v. Killarney
       </i>
       , 523 N.E.2d 467 (Ill. App. Ct. 1988). It may seem unfair that the contributor of services, who contributes little or no capital, should be obligated to contribute toward the capital loss of the large contributor who contributed no services. In entering a partnership with such a capital structure, the partners should foresee that application of the default rule might bring about unusual results and take advantage of their power to vary by agreement the allocation of capital losses.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsections (b) and (c)
       </b>
       —A partnership’s obligation, if any, to reimburse or indemnify others (
    e.g.
    , employees, other agents, and independent contractors) is a question for other law, including the law of agency, contract, and restitution. The fact a person has dissociated as a partner does not affect any obligations incurred by the partnership under these subsections for conduct occurring before the dissociation.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the extent a partnership agreement modifies or displaces the default rules stated in Sections 401 and 409, the agreement should also address these sections. For example, if the partnership agreement establishes a duty of ordinary care (modifying Section 409(c)), the agreement should specify which level of care is necessary to satisfy Subsections (b) and (c). It is not necessary that the levels of care be the same, only that the partnership agreement make the situation clear and thereby avoid difficult issues of interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —UPA (1997) derived this subsection from UPA (1914) § 18(b). The Harmonization Project made two changes: (i) deleting “for the preservation of its business or property” as a separate category for reimbursement, because that category is a subset of the category of “payments made … in the course of the partner’s activities on behalf of the partnership”; and (ii) conditioning reimbursement on the partner’s having complied with the duties stated in Section 409.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reimbursement obligation stated here is a default rule and roughly parallels a rule of agency law.
       Restatement (Third) of Agency § 8.14(2) (2006) (stating that “[a] principal has a duty to indemnify an agent … when the agent makes a payment (i) within the scope of the agent’s actual authority, or (ii) that is beneficial to the principal, unless the agent acts officiously in making the payment”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides for indemnification, but the provision is a default rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule’s eligibility requirements correspond to the default rules on management duties, which is appropriate because otherwise the statutory default rule on indemnification could undercut or even vitiate the statutory default rules on duty. However, subject only to Section 105(c)(8), the partnership agreement can substantially relax the eligibility requirements. The agreement can also impose stricter preconditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although referring broadly to any “person,” this subsection is actually limited to present and former partners. The indemnification obligation applies to only a “debt, obligation, or other liability incurred by the person by reason of the person’s former or present capacity as a partner.” Thus, by its terms this subsection does not apply to a person in the capacity of an officer, manager, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the partnership agreement may mandate indemnification to persons in such positions, as well as to other persons providing services to or acting for the partnership. Within the limitations stated in Section 105(c)(8), a partnership agreement may obligate a partnership to indemnify a person even though the person has breached a duty to the partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       A separate agreement between a partnership and another person may also provide for indemnification. For example, a management contract between a partnership and its managing partner may contain an indemnification provision. The limitations stated in Section 105(c)(8) apply to such separate agreements, for the reasons stated in the comment to that paragraph.

Ch. 2006) (“Because rights to indemnification and advancement differ in important ways, our courts have refused to recognize claims for advancement not granted in specific language clearly suggesting such rights.”). The phrase “hold harmless” likewise does not encompass advances.
       <i>
        Id.
       </i>
       The authorization applies only to those persons eligible for indemnification under Subsection (c), but the partnership agreement certainly can authorize a broader scope and can also make advances obligatory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reference to “ordinary course” pertains to Subsection (k) (stating that any “difference arising in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership may be decided by a majority of the partners”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —This subsection’s language is very broad and authorizes a partnership to purchase insurance to cover (
    e.g.
    , a partner’s intentional misconduct). It is unlikely that such insurance would be available. This authorization comes from the act, not the partnership agreement, and therefore is not subject to Section 105(c)(8) (precluding the partnership agreement from “reliev[ing] or exonerate[ing] a person from liability for conduct involving bad faith, willful or intentional misconduct, or knowing violation of law”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f)
       </b>
       —This subsection was UPA (1997) § 401(d) and is based on UPA (1914) § 18(c).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (g)
       </b>
       —This subsection was UPA (1997) § 401(c) and is based on UPA (1914) § 18(c).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (h)
       </b>
       —This subsection was UPA (1997) § 401(f) and is based on UPA (1914) § 18(e). UPA (1997) § 401, comment 7, suggests that UPA (1914) § 18(e) case law continues to be relevant and notes that Section 18(e) “has been interpreted broadly to mean that, absent contrary agreement, each partner has a continuing right to participate in the management of the partnership and to be informed about the partnership business, even if, per the partnership agreement, the partner’s assent to partnership business decisions is not required.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Note also that for some decisions this act requires the affirmative vote or consent of all partners.
       See, e.g.
    , Subsection (k) (“an act outside the ordinary course of business of a partnership and an amendment to the partnership agreement”); Section 402(b)(3) (becoming a partner after formation of the partnership).
      </p>
      <p>
       The subsection has important implications for a partner’s actual authority to act on behalf of the partnership. The actual authority of a partner is a question of agency law and depends fundamentally on the contents of the partnership agreement. If, however, the partnership agreement is silent on the issue, this subsection helps delineate that actual authority. Acting individually, a partner:
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       has no actual authority to commit the partnership to any matter for which this act requires the affirmative vote or consent of all partners;
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       has the actual authority to commit the partnership to usual and customary matters, unless the partner has reason to know that: (i) other partners might disagree; or (ii) for some other reason consultation with fellow partners is appropriate; and
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       has no actual authority to take unusual or non-customary actions that will have a substantial effect on the partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first point follows self-evidently from the language of this act. Where this act requires unanimity, no partner could reasonably believe to the contrary (unless the partnership agreement provided otherwise).
      </p>
      <p>
       The second point follows because:
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       Subsection (h) serves as the gap-filler manifestation from the partnership to its partners and does
    not
    require partners to act
       <i>
        only
       </i>
       in concert or after consultation. To the contrary, subject to the partnership agreement, this subsection expressly provides that “each partner has equal rights in the management and conduct of the partnership’s business.”
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       It would be impractical to require collective action on even the smallest of decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       However, to the extent a partner has reason to know of a possible difference of opinion among the partner, Subsection (k) requires a decision by at least “a majority of the partners” and by unanimous consent if the matter is “outside the ordinary course of the business.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The third point is a matter of common sense. The more serious the matter, the less likely it is that a partner has actual authority to act unilaterally.
       Cf.
    Restatement (Third) of Agency § 3.03, cmt. c (2006) (noting the unreasonableness of believing, without more facts, that an individual has “an unusual degree of unilateral authority over a matter fraught with enduring consequences for the institution” and stating that “[t]he gravity of the matter from the standpoint of the organization is relevant to whether a third party could reasonably believe that the manager has authority to proceed unilaterally”).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, the authority granted by this subsection includes the authority to delegate. Delegation does not relieve the delegating partner or partners of their duties under Section 409. However, the fact of delegation is a fact relevant to any breach of duty analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A partner personally handles all important paperwork for a partnership. The partner neglects to renew the fire insurance coverage on a building owned by the partnership, despite having received and read a warning notice from the insurance company. The building subsequently burns to the ground and is a total loss. The partner might be liable for breach of the duty of care under Section 409(c) (gross negligence).
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A partner delegates responsibility for insurance renewals to the partnership’s office manager, and that manager neglects to renew the fire insurance coverage on the building. Even assuming that the office manager has been grossly negligent, the partner is not necessarily liable under Section 409(c). The office manager’s gross negligence is not automatically attributed to the partner. Under Section 409(c), the question is whether the partner was grossly negligent (or worse) in selecting the office manager, delegating insurance renewal matters to the office manager, and supervising the general manager after the delegation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement may also provide for delegation and, subject to Section 105(c), may modify a partner’s duties under Section 409 accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (i)
       </b>
       —This subsection states directly what UPA (1914) § 25(2)(a) provides indirectly, through the “tenancy in partnership.” That tenancy reflected the aggregate view of partnership (in the extreme), stated management rights as property rights, and was eliminated by UPA (1997) 401(g). The Harmonization Project relocated the UPA (1997) provision into this subsection.
      </p>
      <p>
       The substance of UPA (1997) § 401(i), which continued the substance of UPA (1914) § 18(g), now appears in Section 402(b)(3) (providing that no person can become a partner without the affirmative vote or consent of all partners).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (j)
       </b>
       —This subsection (i) follows the default rule of UPA (1914) § 18(f) (providing that a partner is not entitled to remuneration for services performed, except in winding up the partnership); while (ii) expanding the exception to include any partner who undertakes winding up. “[R]easonable compensation” includes reimbursement for reasonable expenses.
       Moran v. Willensky
    , 339 S.W.3d 651, 663 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2010) (stating that “the winding up partner … [is] entitled to recover costs associated with the winding up process);
       <i>
        see also O'Reilly's Adm'r v. Brady
       </i>
       , 28 Ala. 530, 535 (1856) (holding that “the surviving partner is entitled, at least, to an allowance and deduction for ‘tavern bills,’ [sic] and ‘other expenses incurred’ ‘in the adjustment and settling up’ of the affairs of the partnership.”). Reasonable expenses include reasonable attorney’s fees, even when the winding up partner has (rightfully) caused the partnership to sue one of the partners.
       <i>
        Moran
       </i>
       ,
       339 S.W.3d at 663 (“Because Mr. Willensky’s capital account had a negative balance, Ms. Moran was well within her rights to sue him to make up that balance.”).
      </p>
      <p>
       In UPA (1997), this subsection was Subsection (h). The Harmonization Project made no change except to relocate the provision.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (k)
       </b>
       —UPA (1997) continued the allocation of management authority stated by UPA (1914) § 18(h), with one important clarification. UPA (1914) § 18(h) requires majority consent for ordinary matters and unanimous consent for amending the partnership but is silent regarding extraordinary matters. Courts have generally required the consent of all partners for those matters.
       See, e.g., Paciaroni v. Crane
    , 408 A.2d 946 (Del. Ch. 1989);
       <i>
        Thomas v. Marvin E. Jewell &amp; Co.
       </i>
       , 440 N.W.2d 437(Neb. 1989);
       <i>
        Duell v. Hancock
       </i>
       , 83 A.D.2d 762 (N.Y. 1981). UPA (1997) codified those cases in § 401(j). The Harmonization Project made no substantive change but relocated the provision to Subsection (k).
      </p>
      <p>
       Other provisions of this act also contain default rules providing for unanimous consent.
       E.g.
    , Sections 402(b)(3) (for a person to become a partner), 504(c) (for compromising a person’s obligation to make a contribution). In addition, absent a contrary provision in the partnership agreement, the transactions authorized under Article 11 each require unanimous consent.

       This section was adopted in the 2011 and 2013 Harmonization amendments and changes UPA (1997) both in style and substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(2)
       </b>
       —Article 11 deals with entity transactions (
    e.g.
    , mergers and conversions). This reference is new, although UPA (1997) Article 9 did contemplate mergers and conversions.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(3)
       </b>
       —A partnership being a creature of contract, consent is determined on an objective basis (
    i.e.
    , contract law’s “reasonable person” standard). Depending on the terms of the partnership agreement, the partners’ manifestation of consent might involve detailed formalities, entirely informal activities, or anything in between. Moreover, the partnership agreement might reduce the quantum of consent necessary or shift the consent right to the management committee or managing partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       A partnership being a voluntary association, a person cannot become a partner without manifesting consent to do so. That consent also is judged objectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 106(b), “[a] person that becomes a partner is deemed to assent to the partnership agreement,” and the agreement binds the partner regardless of whether the partner has actually indicated assent in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(1)

       This section is derived from ULLCA (2006) § 402, was adopted as part of the 2011 and 2013 Harmonization amendments, is intentionally quite broad, and encompasses past, present, and promised benefits.

       Partnership law and practice are in accord.

       This act does not contain a statute of frauds specifically applicable to promised contributions. Generally applicable statutes of fraud might apply, however. For example, a promise to contribute land to a partnership would be subject to the statute of frauds pertaining to land transfers. Likewise, a promise that by its terms requires performance that extends beyond one year from the making of the contract would be subject to the one-year provision of the statute of frauds.

        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —Under common law principles of impracticability, an individual’s death or incapacity will sometimes discharge a duty to render performance.
       Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 261 (Discharge by Supervening Impracticability), 262 (Death or Incapacity of Person Necessary For Performance) (1981). This subsection overrides those principles. Moreover, the reference to “perform personally” is not limited to individuals but rather may refer to any legal person (including an entity) that has a non-delegable duty.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection is a statutory liquidated damage provision, exercisable at the option of the partnership, with the damage amount set according to the value of the promised, non-monetary contribution.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: In order to become a partner, a person promises to contribute to the partnership various assets “free and clear,” which the partnership agreement values at $150,000. In return for the person’s promise, and in light of the agreed value, the partnership admits the person as a partnership with a right to receive twenty-five percent of the partnership’s distributions.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the promised assets are subject to a security agreement, and, before the partner can contribute the assets, the secured party forecloses on the security interest and sells the assets at a public sale for $75,000. Even if the $75,000 reflects the actual fair market value of the assets, under this subsection the partnership has a claim against the partner for “money equal to the value of the part of the contribution which has not been made” –
       i.e.
    , $150,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Same facts as the previous example, except that the public sale brings $225,000. The limited liability company is neither obliged to invoke this subsection nor limited to the $150,000. The LLC may instead sue for breach of the promise to make the contribution, asserting the $225,000 figure as evidence of the actual loss suffered as a result of the breach.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —The unanimity requirement expressed in the first sentence might indirectly benefit creditors, but the requirement is nonetheless a default rule and therefore may be varied in the partnership agreement. The right of each partner to consent is not a “right[] under this [act] of a person other than a partner.”
       See
    Section 105(c)(17) (preventing the partnership agreement from affecting such rights). In contrast, the right stated in the second sentence fits squarely within Section 105(c)(17) and therefore may not be varied by the partnership agreement.

      <p>
       Past uniform unincorporated entity acts and many current limited liability company acts provide default rules for allocation of profits, and UPA (1997) even provides a default configuration for maintaining capital accounts. For the following reasons, this act, incorporating changes made by the Harmonization Project, provides a default rule only for rights to share in distributions:
      </p>
      <p>
       • Capital accounts are maintained for one purpose, to determine how distributions will be made to partners. The rules for maintenance of capital accounts can be very complex. Generally, however, profits increase capital account balances (and increase the amounts that will be distributed to the partners) and losses reduce capital account balances (and reduce the amounts that will be distributed to the partners). If the statute has a simple default rule for how distributions are to be made to the partners, providing an additional set of default profit and loss allocation provisions and capital account rules will be, at best, duplicative and, at worse, inconsistent with the distribution rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Some argue that capital account rules and profit and loss allocation provisions are necessary to comply with tax requirements. Tax income or loss is allocated to partners according to the partners’ economic interests in the partnership, and these interests are based on distributions that would be made to partners on liquidation of the partnership. 106 By including default distribution provisions, the act includes the information necessary to make these tax determinations. To the extent the tax law allows partners to make further tax elections or satisfy alternative safe harbors, the partners may look to the tax law for guidance and include necessary provisions in their agreements.
      </p>

       <b>

       </b>

      </h4>
      <p>
       Both this section and Section 407 were derived essentially from the Model Business Corporation Act section 6.40, and were added during the Harmonization Project. Both sections are necessary and appropriate because a limited liability partnership provides the partners a corporate-like liability shield. With the exception noted in the comment to Subsection (a)(2), the provisions of this section are non-waivable. Section 105(c)(17).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Distribution” does not include “amounts constituting reasonable compensation for present or past service or payments made in the ordinary course of business under a bona fide retirement plan or other bona fide benefits program.” Section 102(4)(B).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —Insolvency is a fundamental issue under this section, and this subsection provides two tests of insolvency. The tests are disjunctive; a distribution violates this section if after the distribution the LLP fails either of the tests. The subsection applies both to interim and liquidating distributions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solvency is also a fundamental issue under bankruptcy and fraudulent transfer law, which provide their own respective definitions of the concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —The reference to “preferential rights upon dissolution and winding up” is a default rule, because removing this protection for preferred partners or transferees is an
       inter se
    matter.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 105(d)(1)(B). The rest of the section is not subject to change in the partnership agreement. Section 105(c)(17).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection states a standard of ordinary care, in contrast with the generally applicable standard stated in Section 409(c) (gross negligence).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(2)
       </b>
       —This alternative valuation provision is likely to be both useful and fair when the partnership has appreciated assets but for accounting purposes these assets are valued at book value less depreciation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides three alternative rules for determining the point(s) in time of as which to apply the solvency tests stated in Subsection (a). The timing depends on which of three categories encompasses a distribution: (i) a distribution in the nature of a redemption (regardless of whether the distribution includes a distribution of indebtedness); (ii) any distribution of indebtedness other than a distribution in the nature of a redemption; and (iii) any distribution that involves neither a redemption nor a distribution of indebtedness. A requirement for additional solvency testing pertaining to distributions of indebtedness appears in Subsection (e).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(1)
       </b>
       —Section 102(4)(A) encompasses distributions in the nature of a redemption.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(1)(A) and (B)
       </b>
       —Under Subparagraph (A), any beginning of payment activity triggers the rule and sets the date as of when to apply the solvency tests. Under Subparagraph (B), the partnership’s complete acquisition of the rights is necessary to trigger the rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(2)
       </b>
       —This provision states the general rule for distributions in the form of debt and which are not connected with a redemption.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(3)
       </b>
       —This provision states alternative rules for all distributions of money or property (
    i.e.
    , not debt). The measuring date depends on the length of time between the authorization and payment of the distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —For a related provision, characterizing as a creditor a person who has become entitled to receive a distribution, see Section 405(d).

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —This subsection contains two rules pertaining to indebtedness issued as part of a distribution and the Subsection (a) solvency tests. The first sentence states the sensible rule that indebtedness that is essentially subordinated to the solvency requirement (
    i.e.
    , not payable if making payment would transgress that requirement) is not counted in determining liabilities for purposes of the solvency tests. The second sentence applies the solvency tests to each payment of principal and interest on any indebtedness issued as a distribution, in addition to any previous testing required by Subsection (c)(1)(A) or (c)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A limited liability partnership and one of its partners agree that the LLP will buy out the person’s entire ownership interest in the LLP in return for a promissory note from the LLP, payable in installments. Under the redemption agreement: (i) on January 15 the person surrenders all its interests and rights and dissociates as a partner; and (ii) the LLP signs and delivers the note to the person on February 15. Under the note, payment of interest is due monthly beginning March 15, with a balloon payment of the principal due December 30.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Subsection (c)(1)(B), the solvency tests are applied as of January 15. Under Subsection (e), the solvency tests are again applied on the March 15, April 15, etc., and again on December 30.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f)
       </b>
       —The cited sections provide methods for extinguishing or limiting the debts of an LLP that is winding up its affairs and activities and thus any debt affected by any of the cited sections is irrelevant for purposes of solvency testing.

      <p>
       This section contemplates two categories of liability: liability of those who have authorized improper distributions (Subsection (a) –

    , the partners) and the liability of those who have received improper distributions (Subsection (c) –
       <i>

      <p>
       The liability is to the LLP, not to the creditors of an insolvent
       LLP.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Subsections (a) and (c) derive from UPA (1997). The other subsections are derived from the ULPA (2001) § 401 (rights to information of general partners and former general partners) and were adopted as part of the 2011 and 2103 Harmonization amendments. The rules stated here might be termed “quasi-default rules”—subject to some change by the partnership agreement.
       See
    Section 105(c)(4) (prohibiting unreasonable restrictions on the information rights stated in this section).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the rights and duties stated in this section are extensive, they are not necessarily all-inclusive. This act’s statement of fiduciary duties is not exhaustive,
       see
    the comment to Section 409(a), and some cases characterize owners’ information rights as reflecting a fiduciary duty of those with management power.
       <i>

       </i>
       , No. Civ.A. 1844–N, 2006 WL 3927242, at *14 (Del. Ch. Oct. 16, 2006) (holding that an LLC manager owed “certain duties to members of the LLC” and stating that “[w]hen fiduciaries communicate with their beneficiaries in the context of asking the beneficiary to make a discretionary decision—such as whether to consent to a sale of substantially all the assets of an LLC—the fiduciary has a duty to disclose all material facts bearing on the decision at issue”) (citing

        Loudon v. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.
       </i>
       , 700 A.2d 135, 137 (Del. 1997)).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —A general partnership is often a very informal organization. Accordingly, this subsection states a default-required location for any books and records a partnership may have but does not require that books and records be kept. Other law may so require, however—particularly tax law. This subsection applies to any books and records kept to satisfy other law.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection states the rule pertaining to information memorialized in “any record maintained by the partnership.” For the meaning of “material” as applied to information, see Section 409(f), comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsections (c) and (d)
       </b>
       —In appropriate circumstances, violation of either or both of these provisions might cause a court to enjoin or even rescind action taken by the partnership, especially when the violation has interfered with an approval or veto mechanism involving partner consent.
       E.g., Blue Chip Emerald L.L.C. v. Allied Partners Inc.
    , 299 A.D.2d 278, 279–80 (N.Y. App. Div. 2002) (invoking partnership law precedent as reflecting a duty of full disclosure and holding that “[a]bsent such full disclosure, the transaction is voidable”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This subsection imposes a duty on the partnership, not the partners. However, a partner could be liable in damages if the partner were to: (i) breach a duty under Section 409 or the partnership agreement; and (ii) in doing so cause or suffer the partnership to breach the duty stated in this paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(1)
       </b>
       —This provision imposes an affirmative duty to volunteer information. However, given the assumption that each partner will be active in management, the obligation 115 ceases “to the extent the partnership can establish that it reasonably believes the partner already knows the information.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, the obligation is limited to information that is both material and known by the partnership. “Knowledge” is viewed subjectively (
    i.e.
    , actual knowledge). Section 103(a)(1). Materiality is viewed objectively. Thus, the duty applies to known, material information, even if the partnership does not know that the information is material.
      </p>
      <p>
       A partnership will “know” what its partners know. Under Section 103(e), “[a] partner’s knowledge … of a fact relating to the partnership is effective immediately as knowledge of or notice to the partnership.” As to others acting or reasonably appearing to act on behalf of the partnership, common law agency rules will apply.
       Restatement (Third) of Agency § 5.03 (2006) (Imputation of Notice of Fact to Principal).
      </p>
      <p>
       Typically a partner’s duties are continuous, and therefore a partner’s right to information is not just transaction-specific. Ongoing managerial responsibilities require ongoing information—both periodically and
       ad hoc
    when a situation warrants.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the meaning of “material” as applied to information, see Section 409(f), comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(2)
       </b>
       —Other law determines which party has the burden of proof as to the stated exception.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —This subsection imposes a duty directly on each partner, “except to the extent the [partner] can establish that it reasonably believes [another] partner already knows the information.”
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A partnership has two partners: each of which is regularly engaged in conducting the partnership’s activities; both of which are aware of and have regular access to all significant partnership records; and neither of which has special responsibility for or knowledge of any particular aspect of those activities or the relevant partnership records. Most likely, neither partner is obliged to draw the other general partner’s attention to information apparent in the partnership’s records.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Although a partnership has three partners, one is the managing partner with day-to-day responsibility for running the partnership’s activities. The other two meet periodically with the managing partner and together with that partner function in a manner analogous to a corporate board of directors. Most likely, the managing partner has a duty to draw the attention of the other partners to important information, even if that information would be apparent from a review of the partnership’s records.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because this subsection imposes duties directly on partner, the duties are in the nature of a contractual obligation, and breach is a matter of strict liability. For example, it is no defense for a partner under this section to assert that, although the partner failed to furnish required information, the failure did not amount to gross negligence under Section 409(c).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —Codifying the information rights of former owners began with UPA (1997) § 403(b).
      </p>
      <p>
       For the additional information rights of the legal representative of a deceased partner, see Section 505.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)(1)
       </b>
       —A person dissociated as a partner has information rights in that capacity only as to the period during which the person was a partner. To the extent that further information is accessible under Section 505(2) (providing access to the legal representative of a deceased partner), that access is limited both in purpose (“for purposes of settling the estate”) and in scope (“the rights the deceased partner had under Section 408”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)(2)
       </b>
       —A duty of good faith is needed here, because a person claiming access under this subsection is no longer a partner and is no longer subject to a partner’s obligation of good faith and fair dealing under Section 409(d).
       See
    Section 603(b)(2) (stating a person’s dissociation as a partner terminates as to subsequent events the person’s duties under Section 409, including the contractual obligation of good faith).

      </p>
      <p>
       In the context of Subsection (e)(2), “good faith” is properly understood to mean an honest belief that the request is made for a proper purpose.
       Associated Indem. Corp. v. CAT Contracting, Inc.
    , 964 S.W.2d 276, 285 (Tex. 1998) (holding that “‘good faith’ in the surety agreement before us refers to conduct which is honest in fact, free of improper motive or wilful ignorance of the facts at hand”);
       Andrews v. Bible, 812 S.W.2d 284, 288 (Tenn. 1991) (describing “subjective good faith” as “[a] pure heart but an empty head”) (quoting
       <i>
        Whittington v. Ohio River Co.
       </i>
       , 115 F.R.D. 201, 209 (E.D.Ky.1987)). Willful ignorance includes being an ostrich. “While ‘honesty’ may require no more than a pure heart, it is questionable that a pure heart can co-exist with closed eyes. It is not honest to close one's eyes so as to maintain an empty head.”

       UPA (1914) § (3)(1) (“A person has ‘knowledge’ of a fact within the meaning of this act not only when he has actual knowledge thereof, but also when he has knowledge of such other facts as in the circumstances shows bad faith.”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (h)
       </b>
       —For the avoidance of doubt, this subsection expressly authorizes taking action through an agent. The doubt might arise from old corporate cases in which the parties contested a shareholder’s right to exercise inspection rights through another person.
       White v. Coeur D'Alene Big Creek Mining Co.
    , 55 P.2d 720, 723 (Idaho 1936) (stating that “[t]he refusal to permit respondent [shareholder] to appoint his own attorney or agent to make the examination [of the corporation’s books] was in effect a denial of his right” of inspection);
       <i>
        State v. Monida &amp; Yellowstone Stage Co.
       </i>
       , 124 N.W. 971, 972 (Minn. 1910) (upholding a trial court’s mandamus order, “which shall provide that [the shareholder complainant], or such attorney or agent as he may select, … shall be allowed to inspect the books, records, and papers of the defendant [corporation]”).
      </p>
      <p>
       No negative inference should be drawn about using agents to take other action under this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (j)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides fallback protection for gaps in the partnership agreement. For example, the partners may protect trade secrets from disclosure and prohibit various misuses of confidential information even if the partnership agreement omits to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reference to “ordinary course” pertains to Section 401(k) (stating that any “matter in the ordinary course of business of a partnership may be decided by a majority of the partners”). This approach is necessary, lest a requesting partner have the power to block imposition of a reasonable restriction or condition needed to prevent the requestor from abusing the partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of persuasion under this subsection contrasts with the burden of persuasion under Section 105(c)(4) (prohibiting unreasonable limitations on the information rights provided by this section). Under that paragraph, as a matter of ordinary procedural law the burden is on the person making the claim.

      <p>
       This section originated as UPA (1997) § 404. The 2011 and 2013 Harmonization amendments made one major substantive change; they “un-cabined” fiduciary duty. UPA (1997) § 404 had deviated substantially from UPA (1914) by purporting to codify all fiduciary duties owed by partners. This approach had a number of problems. Most notably, the exhaustive list of fiduciary duties left no room for the fiduciary duty owed by partners to each other –
       i.e.
    , “the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive”).
       <i>
        Meinhard v. Salmon
       </i>
       , 164 N.E. 545, 546 (N.Y. 1928). Although UPA (1997) § 404(b) purported to state “[a] partner’s duty of loyalty to the partnership
       <i>
        and the other partners
       </i>
       ” (emphasis added), the three listed duties each protected the partnership and not the partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Un-cabining” harmonized this act to ULLCA (2006), and this section states some of the core aspects of the fiduciary duty of loyalty, provides a duty of care, and incorporates the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing. The duties stated in this section are subject to the partnership agreement, but Sections 105(c) and (d) contain important limitations on the power of the partnership agreement to affect fiduciary and other duties and the obligation of good faith and fair dealing.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the effect of dissociation on a person’s duties under this section, see Section 603(b)(2).

        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection recognizes two core managerial duties but, unlike UPA (1997), does not purport to be exhaustive. For example, many cases characterize a manager’s duty to disclose as a fiduciary duty.
       E.g., Lonergan v. EPE Holdings, L.L.C.
    , 5 A.3d 1008, 1023 (Del. Ch. 2010) (stating that “in the limited partnership context, absent contractual modification, a general partner owes fiduciary duties that include a duty of full disclosure”) (quotation marks omitted) (citation omitted);
       <i>
        Exxon Corp. v. Burglin
       </i>
       , 4 F.3d 1294, 1298 (5th Cir. 1993) (“Under Alaska law, a general partner stands in a fiduciary relationship with the limited partnership and thereby owes ‘a fiduciary duty … to disclose information concerning partnership affairs.’”) (quoting
       <i>
        Parker v. N. Mixing Co.
       </i>
       , 756 P.2d 881, 894 (Alaska 1988)).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection states three core aspects of the fiduciary duty of loyalty: (i) not “usurping” partnership opportunities or otherwise wrongly benefiting from the partnership’s operations or property; (ii) avoiding conflict of interests in dealing with the partnership (whether directly or on behalf of another); and (iii) refraining from competing with the partnership. Essentially the same duties exist in agency law and under the law of all types of business organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection applies beginning with “the partnership’s business,” which by definition cannot exist before the partnership does; thus the stated duties do not apply to pre-formation activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stated duties comprise a default rule. Under Section 105(d)(3)(A): “If not manifestly unreasonable, the partnership agreement may … alter or eliminate the aspects of the duty of loyalty stated in Section 409(b).”
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)
       </b>
       —The phrase “hold as trustee” dates back to UPA (1914) § 21 and reflects the availability of disgorgement remedies, such as a constructive trust. In contrast to an actual trustee, a person subject to this duty does not: (i) face the special obstacles to consent characteristic of trust law; or (ii) enjoy protection for decisions taken in reliance on the governing instrument and other sources of information.
       Cf.
    Uniform Statutory Trust Entity Act (2009) (Last Amended 2013) § 506 (“A trustee [of a statutory trust]… is not liable to the trust or to a beneficial owner for breach of any duty,
       <i>
        including a fiduciary duty
       </i>
       , to the extent the breach results from reasonable reliance on: (i) a term of the governing instrument; (ii) a record of the statutory trust; or (iii) an opinion, report, or statement of another person that the person to which the opinion, report, or statement is made or delivered reasonably believes is within the other person’s professional or expert competence and is made or delivered to the trustee … .”) (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)(A)
       </b>
       —This provision is consistent with a basic principle of agency law—namely, that an agent may not benefit at all from the performance of the agency unless the 120 principal consents.
       Restatement (Third) of Agency § 8.06, cmt. c. (2006). Typically, however, the partnership agreement will legitimize particular benefits –
       e.g.
    , a management fee paid to a managing partner in addition to that partner’s share of distributions. Also, an agreed allocation of distributions takes those benefits outside the reach of this provision.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)(B)
       </b>
       —For the expansive meaning of “property,” see Section 102(16). The term includes confidential information.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)(C)
       </b>
       —This act does not specify what constitutes “a partnership opportunity,” but ample case law exists.
       See, e.g., Triple Five of Minn., Inc. v. Simon
    , 404 F.3d 1088, 1096 (8th Cir. 2005) (“An opportunity that is closely related to the entity's existing or prospective line of business, would competitively advantage the partnership, and is one that the partnership has the financial ability, knowledge and experience to pursue is a partnership opportunity.”);
       <i>
        Knudson v. Kyllo
       </i>
       , 831 N.W.2d 763, 767 (N.D. 2013) (explaining why conducting farming operations on land owned by others was a partnership opportunity while purchasing farmland was not).
      </p>
      <p>
       The duty stated here continues through winding up, although in that context the scope of partnership opportunities inevitably narrows.
      </p>
      <p>
       In most, if not all, situations, usurping a partnership opportunity also breaches the duty not to compete, Paragraph (b)(3), but not vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(2)
       </b>
       —In this context, the phrase “adverse interest” is a term of art, meaning “to be on the other side of the table” in some dealing with the partnership. Absent informed consent by the partnership, this duty is breached by the mere existence of the conflict of interest and the partnership need not prove that the outcome of the dealing was adverse to the partnership.
       But see
    Subsection (g) (permitting the defense of fairness).This duty continues through winding up.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(3)
       </b>
       —Although competition is often thought of in terms of potential customers, this duty applies equally to competition for resources, including employees. This duty ends when the partnership dissolves.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This act no longer refers to the duty of care as a fiduciary duty, because: (i) the duty of care applies in many non-fiduciary situations; and (ii) breach of the duty of care is remediable in damages while breach of a fiduciary duty gives rise also to equitable remedies, including disgorgement, constructive trust, and rescission.
      </p>
      <p>
       The change in label is consistent with the
       Restatement (Third) of Agency section 8.02 (2006), which refers to the agent’s “fiduciary duty” to act loyally, but eschews the word “fiduciary” when stating the agent’s duties of “care, competence, and diligence.”
       Id.
    § 8.08. However, the label change is merely semantics; no change in the law is intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement can raise the standard of care, or subject to Sections 105(c)(8) and (d)(3)(C), lower it. A person’s practical exposure for breaching the duty of care involves not 121 only the standard of care but also any partnership agreement provision that: (i) exonerates the person from liability for breach of the duty of care, Section 105(c)(8); or (ii) entitles the person to indemnification despite such breach, Section 408(b), cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —This subsection refers to the “
    contractual
    obligation of good faith and fair dealing” (emphasis added) and thereby invokes the implied obligation that exists in every contract.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Restatement (Second) Contracts § 205 (1981) (“Every contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement.”). The adjective (“contractual”) should help avoid decisions like
       <i>
        Phelps v. Frampton
       </i>
       , 170 P.3d 474, 483 (Mont. 2007) (holding that Montana’s version of UPA (1997) creates a statutory obligation of good faith and fair dealing separate from the implied contractual covenant).
      </p>
      <p>
       At first glance, it may seem strange to apply a contractual obligation to statutory duties and rights –
       i.e.
    , duties and rights “under this [act].” However, for the most part those duties and rights apply to relationships
       <i>
        inter se
       </i>
       the partners and the partnership and function only to the extent not displaced by the partnership agreement. Those statutory default rules are thus intended to function like a contract; applying the contractual notion of good faith and fair dealing therefore makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The contractual obligation of “good faith” has nothing to do with the corporate concept of good faith that for years bedeviled courts and attorneys trying to understand: (i) Delaware’s famous corporate law exoneration provision; and (ii) that provision’s exception “for acts or omissions not in good faith.”
       Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 102(b)(7) (2012). In that context, good faith is an aspect of the duty of loyalty.
       See Stone ex rel. AmSouth Bancorporation v. Ritter
    , 911 A.2d 362, 369–70 (Del. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing has nothing to do with the “utmost good faith” sometimes used to describe the fiduciary duties that owners of closely held businesses owe each other.
       See, e.g., Meinhard v. Salmon
    , 477, 164 N.E. 545, 551 (NY 1928) (“[W]here parties engage in a joint enterprise each owes to the other the duty of the utmost good faith in all that relates to their common venture. Within its scope they stand in a fiduciary relationship.”);
       <i>
        Donahue v. Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, Inc.
       </i>
       , 328 N.E.2d 505, 515 (Mass. 1975) (“[S]tockholders in the close corporation owe one another substantially the same fiduciary duty in the operation of the enterprise that partners owe to one another. In our previous decisions, we have defined the standard of duty owed by partners to one another as the utmost good faith and loyalty.”) (footnotes omitted) (citations omitted) (internal quotations omitted).
      </p>
      <p>
       To the contrary, the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing is not a fiduciary duty, does not command altruism or self-abnegation, and does not prevent a partner from acting in the partner’s own self-interest:
      </p>
      
      <p>
       “Fair dealing” is not akin to the fair process component of entire fairness, , whether the fiduciary acted fairly when engaging in the challenged transaction as measured by duties of loyalty and care … . It is rather a commitment to deal “fairly” in the sense of consistently with the terms of the parties' agreement and its purpose. Likewise “good faith” does not envision loyalty to the contractual 122 counterparty, but rather faithfulness to the scope, purpose, and terms of the parties' contract. Both necessarily turn on the contract itself and what the parties would have agreed upon had the issue arisen when they were bargaining originally. i.e.

       Subsection (e).
      </p>
      <p>
       Courts should not use the contractual obligation to change
       ex post facto
    the parties’ or this act’s allocation of risk and power. To the contrary, the obligation should be used only to protect agreed-upon arrangements from conduct that is manifestly beyond what a reasonable person could have contemplated when the arrangements were made.
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement or this act may grant discretion to a partner, and the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing is especially salient when discretion is at issue. However, a partner may properly exercise discretion even though another partner suffers as a consequence. Conduct does not violate the obligation of good faith and fair dealing merely because that conduct substantially prejudices a party. Indeed, parties allocate risk precisely because prejudice may occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       The exercise of discretion constitutes a breach of the obligation of good faith and fair dealing only when the party claiming breach shows that the conduct has no honestly held purpose that legitimately comports with the parties’ agreed-upon arrangements:
      </p>
      
      <p>
       An implied covenant claim … looks to the past. It is not a free-floating duty unattached to the underlying legal documents. It does not ask what duty the law should impose on the parties given their relationship at the time of the wrong, but . rather what the parties would have agreed to themselves had they considered the issue in their original bargaining positions at the time of contracting

      </p>
      <p>
       In sum, the purpose of the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing is to protect the arrangement the partners have chosen for themselves, not to restructure that arrangement under the guise of safeguarding it.

       As to the power of the partnership agreement to affect the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing, see Section 105(c)(6) (prohibiting elimination but allowing the agreement to “prescribe standards, if not manifestly unreasonable, by which the performance of the obligation is to be measured”). For examples, see Section 105(c)(6), comment. As to whether the obligation stated in this subsection applies to the benefit of transferees, see Section 107(b), comment.

        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —A partner in a general partnership has at least two different roles: (i) as a party to the partnership agreement, with rights and obligations under that agreement; and (ii) as co-manager of the enterprise. This provision pertains to the first role. A partner’s exercise of rights under the partnership agreement is subject to the obligation of good faith and fair dealing, Subsection (d), but a partner does not breach that contractual obligation “solely because the partner’s conduct furthers the partner’s own interest.” In contrast, this provision is ineffective with regard to a partner’s duties as co-manager. For example, a partner’s liability under Section 409(b)(3) (prohibiting competition) is not “solely because the partner’s conduct furthers the partner’s own interest.” Rather, the liability results from the breach of a specific obligation –
       i.e.

      <p>
       In UPA (1997) this section was Section 405. The Harmonization Project did not change the section other than to renumber it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection originated in UPA (1997) § 405(a) and reflects the entity theory of partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection is the successor to UPA (1914) § 22 but with significant changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       UPA (1914) § 22 itself had made significant changes to the common law. “It … generally was established at common law that an equitable accounting was a condition precedent to an action in law between partners,”
       Thompson v. Coughlin
    , 997 P.2d 191, 194 (Or. 2000), and an accounting was generally not available before dissolution. Thus, claims among partners pertaining the partnership could not be asserted except through an action for dissolution and accounting. UPA (1914) § 22 modified this “exclusivity rule,” specifying certain circumstances in which an accounting action is available without requiring an action to dissolve the partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       UPA (1997) eliminated the "exclusivity rule” entirely; an action of dissolution and accounting remains available but is no longer “a condition precedent” to other claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection authorizes a partner to bring claims “to enforce the partner’s rights and protect the partner’s interests” –
       i.e.
    , direct claims. The statutory language does not contemplate derivative claims; thus, this act neither authorizes nor precludes such claims.
       <i>
        See Tzolis v. Wolff
       </i>
       , 884 N.E.2d 1005 (N.Y. 2008) (rejecting the argument that “members of a limited liability company (LLC) may [not] bring derivative suits on the LLC’s behalf, … [because] there are no provisions governing such suits in the Limited Liability Company Law”).
      </p>
      <p>
       The case law does generally recognize the direct/derivative distinction in the context of general partnerships, and some cases permit a partner to sue derivatively.
       E.g., Hill v. Vanderbilt Capital Advisors, L.L.C.
    , 834 F. Supp. 2d 1228, 1246 (D.N.M. 2011) (stating that “[t]he Supreme Court of New Mexico extended the scope of derivative suits beyond the corporate context … and allowed a partner's derivative suit on behalf of a general partnership”) (citations omitted).
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, however, the cases are conflicting and somewhat confused. A decision of the Maryland Court of Special Appeals illustrates the situation. At one point the court states:
      </p>
      
      <p>
       We agree that the term “derivative” is an inappropriate and confusing term to use in the general partnership context. “Derivative” actions are necessary in the corporate and limited partnership context, where the shareholders and limited partners have no managerial rights and thus must “derive” the right to sue from the entity itself. Unlike shareholders and limited partners, however, general partners all have the ability to act on behalf of the partnership, and all have management rights [citations omitted]. Thus, general partners have no need for “derivative” action.

However, later in the opinion the court recognizes that the partners’ “ability to act on behalf of the partnership, and … [the partners’] management rights” are ineffective when a partner with a controlling interest declines to cause the partnership to sue the controlling partner for alleged misconduct.

       For the definition of transferable interest, see Section 102(23). Absent a contrary provision in the partnership agreement or the consent of the partners, a “transferable interest” is the only interest in a partnership that can be transferred to a person not already a partner.
    See
    Section 503. As to whether a partner may transfer governance rights to a fellow partner, the question is moot absent a provision in the partnership agreement changing the default rule,
       <i>
        see
       </i>
       Section 401(h) (allocating governance rights
       <i>
        per capita
       </i>
       ). In the default mode, a partner’s transfer of governance rights to another partner: (i) does not increase the transferee’s governance rights; (ii) eliminates the transferor’s governance rights; (iii) and thereby changes the denominator but not the numerator in calculating governance rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: LCN Company is a general partnership with three partners, Laura, Charles, and Nora. The partnership agreement does not displace this act’s default rule on the allocation of governance rights among general partners. Thus, each partner has 1/3 of those rights. Laura transfers her entire ownership interest to Charles. The transfer does not increase Charles’s governance rights but does eliminate Laura’s. After the transfer, Laura has no governance rights (regardless of whether Charles and Nora agree to expel Laura under Section 601(4)(B)). As a result, Charles and Nora each have 1/2 of the governance rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a transferable interest pledged as security is governed by Article 8 or 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code depends on the rules stated in those Articles.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       One of the most fundamental characteristics of partnership law is its fidelity to the “pick your partner” principle.
    See, e.g., Bynum v. Frisby
    , 311 P.2d 972, 975 (Nev. 1957) (stating that (i) “the assignment of a partnership interest from one partner to a stranger does not bring that stranger into fiduciary relationship with the remaining partners”; and (ii) absent consent by the remaining partners “[t]he stranger remains a stranger” with no rights to management or even information). This section is the core of the act’s provisions reflecting and protecting that principle. A partner’s rights in a partnership are bifurcated into economic rights (the transferable interest) and governance rights (including management rights, consent rights, rights to information, rights to seek judicial intervention). Unless the partnership agreement otherwise provides, a partner acting without the consent of all other partners lacks both the power and the right to: (i) bestow partnership on a non-partner, Section 402(b)(3); or (ii) transfer to a non-partner anything other than some or all of the partner’s transferable interest, Section 503(a)(3). The rights of a mere transferee are quite limited (
       <i>
        i.e
       </i>
       ., to receive distributions), Section 503(b), and, if the partnership dissolves and winds up, to receive specified information pertaining to the partnership from the date of dissolution, Section 503(c).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section applies regardless of whether the transferor is a partner, a transferee of a partner, a transferee of a transferee, etc.
    See
    Section 102(23) (defining “transferable interest” in terms of a right “initially owned by a person in the person’s capacity as a partner” regardless of “whether or not the person remains a partner or continues to own any part of the right”).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not directly consider whether a partner may transfer governance rights to another partner without obtaining consent from all the other partners. As noted in Section 502, comment, the question is moot under this act’s default rule for allocating governance rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the question can be pivotal when the partnership agreement displaces the default rule on governance rights but does not determine whether transfer restrictions (whether contractual, statutory, or both) apply to transfers of governance rights from one partner to another. Case law is scant and pertains to limited liability companies. Nonetheless, the cases suggest that this act does not protect partners from control shifts that result from transfers among partners.
    Blythe v. Bell
    , No. 11 CVS 933, 2012 WL 7807800, at ¶ 6 (N.C. Dist. Dec. 10, 2012) (holding in a case of “first impression in North Carolina” that “in the absence of articles of incorporation or an operating agreement to the contrary … the assignment of control [
       <i>
        i.e.
       </i>
       , governance] interests between members is effective without unanimous member consent”);

       </i>
       , 25 A.3d 800, 810 (Del. Ch. 2011) (Strine, Ch.) (holding that the terms of the LLC agreement did not preclude one member of a three-member LLC from transferring the member’s entire interest (including governance rights) to a second member without first having the consent of the third member; stating that the third member’s “argument relies on a very thinly sliced version of [the “pick-your-partner” principle, the strained version being] … that once one chooses his initial co-members, one continues to hold a veto over how much additional voting power they may acquire” explaining that “[t]he problem for [the third member] is that nothing in the LLC Agreement supports [that member’s] reading of it that would require an already admitted Member, like [the acquirer –
       <i>
        i.e.
       </i>
       , the second member], to be become once, twice (or even three times) a Member each and every time that Member acquires an additional block of Interests”).
      </p>
      <p>
       Other law may affect the applicability of this section.
    See
    11 U.S.C. § 541(c)(1) (providing that, initially at least, all property of a debtor becomes part of the bankruptcy estate regardless of restrictions on transfer); UCC §§ 9-406, 9-408 (overriding specified restrictions on assignment in specified circumstances, regardless of whether state law or a contract imposes the restrictions).
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, this section does not apply to the transfer of ownership interests in a partner that is an entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: ABC, Partnership (“ABC”) has three partners: Ralph (an individual), Alice, Inc. (“Alice”), and Norton, LLC (“Norton”). Section 502 applies to any attempt by Ralph, Alice, or Norton to transfer their respective partnership interest in ABC. Section 502 is inapplicable, however, to a change in control of Alice or Norton or even a complete change in their respective ownership.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —The definition of “transfer,” Section 102(22), and this subsection’s reference to “in whole or in part” combine to mean that this section encompasses not only unconditional, permanent, and complete transfers but also temporary, contingent, and partial ones. Thus, for example, a charging order under Section 504 effects a transfer of part of the judgment debtor’s transferable interest, as does the pledge of a transferable interest as collateral for a loan and the gift of a life-interest in a partner’s rights to distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —The phrase “by itself” contemplates Section 601(4)(B), which creates a risk of dissociation via expulsion when a partner transfers all of the partner’s transferable interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(3)
       </b>
       —Mere transferees have no right to participate in management or otherwise intrude as the partners carry on the business of the partnership and their activities as partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because Section 102(22)(G) defines “transfer” to include “a transfer by operation of law,” this section affects the power of other law to effect transfers of a partner’s ownership interest. For example, a divorce court lacks the power to award a partner’s spouse anything beyond the partner’s transferable interest. Nor does the partner have the power to enter into a property settlement purporting to effect any greater transfer.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the divorce court, the best solution is to value the partner’s complete ownership interest (
    i.e.
    , the transferable interest as enhanced by the management and information rights and the standing to sue) and: (i) if possible, award the partner’s spouse marital property of equal value; or (ii) if not possible, award the partner’s spouse a money judgment and a charging order to enforce the judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granting the non-partner any part of a partner’s transferable interest is almost always imprudent; marital discord will almost inevitably carry over into the business relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granting the partner’s ex-spouse the entire transferable interest is rarely a viable alternative. If the partner is active participant in the partnership, the approach is impossible. The partner’s transferable interest will typically constitute much or all of the partner’s remuneration for the partner’s activity. Even if the partner is essentially passive, granting the transferable interest to the ex-spouse puts him or her at great risk as a “bare naked assignee.”
    See
    the comment to Section 107(b).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a partner dies, subject to the partnership agreement other law may effect a transfer of the partner’s transferable interest to the partner’s estate or personal representative. However, for the reasons just stated, other law lacks the power to transfer anything more than a transferable interest. (Section 505 does provide extra information rights for the purposes of settling the estate of the deceased partner.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(3)(B)
       </b>
       —For a related provision, providing that that section’s information rights do not apply to transferees, see Section 408(i).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —Amounts due under this subsection are of course subject to offset for any amount owed to the partnership by the partner or person dissociated as a partner on whose account the distribution is made. Section 405(d). As to whether a partnership may properly offset for claims against a transferor that was never a partner is matter for other law, specifically the law of contracts dealing with assignments.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This very limited grant of information rights encompasses only transactions occurring at or after the date of the partnership’s dissolution. The transferee has only the right to information as to the allocation of net assets among the partnership’s creditors, partners, and transferees—and only from the date of dissolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection does not prevent a transferee from contracting with a partner-transferor to require the partner-transferor to disclose further information to the transferee. Whether such an agreement would breach the partnership agreement, the implied contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing, Section 409(d), or a fiduciary duty depends on the circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a dissolved partnership rescinds its dissolution, Section 803, this subsection no longer applies.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —This provision originated as UPA (1997) § 503(e), was then consistent with Uniform Commercial Code section 9-318(3), and is now consistent with section 9-406(a) (stating that “an account debtor … may discharge its obligation by paying the assignor until, but not after, the account debtor receives a notification, authenticated by the assignor or the assignee, that the amount due or to become due has been assigned and that payment is to be made to the assignee”).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “notice” includes “reason to know,” Section 103(b)(1), and ordinarily a potential transferee has reason to inquire about transfer restrictions that might be contained in the partnership agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f)
       </b>
       —Under this subsection, a partner remains a partner (with all attendant rights and obligations) even after permanently transferring the entirety of the transferable interest, unless: (i) the other partners opt for expulsion under Section 601(4)(B); or (ii) as otherwise provided in the partnership agreement.

      <p>
       The charging order concept dates back to the English Partnership Act of 1890 and in the United States has been a fundamental part of law of unincorporated business organizations since 1914.
       See
    UPA (1914) § 28. As much a remedy limitation as a remedy, the charging order is the sole method by which a person acting as judgment creditor of a partner or transferee can extract value from the partner’s or transferee’s ownership interest in a partnership.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       the comment to Subsection (g).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, the judgment creditor of a partner or transferee is entitled to a charging order against the relevant transferable interest. While in effect, that order entitles the judgment creditor to whatever distributions would otherwise be due to the partner or transferee whose interest is subject to the order. However, the judgment creditor has no say in the timing or amount of those distributions. The charging order does not entitle the judgment creditor to accelerate any distributions or to otherwise interfere with the management and activities of the partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       By its terms, this section does not apply to foreign partnerships.
       See
    Section 102(11) (defining “partnership” to mean “an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit
       <i>
        formed under this [act]
       </i>
       ”) (emphasis added).
       <i>
        See also Fannie Mae v. Heather Apartments Ltd. P'ship

       , A13-0562, 2013 WL 6223564, at *6 (Minn. Ct. App. Dec. 2, 2013) (considering the remedies available to a judgment creditor with respect to the judgment debtor’s interest in a Cook Islands LLC; rejecting the debtor’s argument that the creditor’s “only remedy is to obtain a charging order under” the Minnesota LLC statute; explaining that “this argument fails because that statute only applies to Minnesota limited liability companies” which that statute “defines … as ‘a limited liability company, other than a foreign limited liability company,
       <i>
        organized or governed by this chapter
       </i>
       ’”) (emphasis added) (statutory citations omitted).
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement has no power to alter the provisions of this section to the prejudice of third parties. Section 105(c)(17).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —The phrase “judgment debtor” encompasses both partners and transferees. The lien pertains only to a distribution, which excludes “amounts constituting reasonable compensation for present or past service or payments made in the ordinary course of business under a bona fide retirement plan or other bona fide benefits program.” Section 102(4)(B). A judgment creditor that wishes to levy on such amounts should use the appropriate creditor’s remedy, such as garnishment (which may be subject to exemptions or exclusions not relevant to a charging order).
       Cf. PB Real Estate, Inc. v. Dem II Props.
    , 719 A.2d 73, 76 (Conn. Ct. App. 1998) (rejecting the contention of an LLC’s two members that “payments of $28,000 to each of them” should be treated “as expenses for wages” rather than as distributions).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether an application for a charging order must be served on the partnership, the judgment debtor, or both is a matter for other law, principally the law of remedies and civil procedure. The order itself must be served on the partnership. Whether the order must also be served on the judgment debtor is a matter for other law.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a distribution consists of rights to acquire interests in a partnership, the charging order applies only to those rights within the definition of transferable interest.
       See
    Section 102(23) (defining transferable interest).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —Paragraph (2) refers to “other orders” rather than “additional orders.” Therefore, given appropriate circumstances, a court may invoke Paragraph (1), Paragraph (2), or both.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)
       </b>
       —The receiver contemplated here is emphatically not a receiver for the partnership, but rather a receiver for the distributions subject to the charging order. The principal advantage provided by this paragraph is an expanded right to information. However, that right goes no further than “the extent necessary to effectuate the collections of distributions pursuant to a charging order.” For a correctly narrow reading of this provision, see
       Wells Fargo Bank, Nat. Ass'n v. Continuous Control Solutions, Inc.
    , No. 11–1285, 2012 WL 3195759 (Iowa Ct. App. Aug. 8, 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(2)
       </b>
       —This paragraph must be understood in the context of: (i) the very limited nature of the charging order; and (ii) the importance of preventing overreaching on behalf of a person that is not a judgment creditor of the partnership, has no claim on the partnership’s assets, and has no right to interfere in the activities, affairs, and management of the partnership. In particular, the court’s power to make “all other orders” is limited to “orders necessary to give effect to the charging order.”
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A judgment creditor with a charging order believes that the partnership should invest less of its surplus in operations, leaving more funds for distributions. The creditor moves the court for an order directing the partnership to restrict re-investment. Subsection (b)(2) does not authorize the court to grant the motion.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A judgment creditor with a judgment for $10,000 against a partner obtains a charging order against the partner’s transferable interest. Having been properly served with the order, the partnership nonetheless fails to comply and makes a $3000 distribution to the partner. The court has the power to order the partnership to pay $3000 to the judgment creditor to “give effect to the charging order.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Subsection (b)(2), the court has the power to decide whether a particular payment is a distribution, because that decision determines whether the payment is part of a transferable interest subject to a charging order.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Partner A of ABC, a general partnership, has for some years received distributions form the partnership. However, when a judgment creditor of Partner A obtains a charging order against Partner A’s transferable interest, the partnership ceases to make distributions to Partner A and instead provides a salary to Partner A equivalent to former distributions. A court might deem this salary a disguised distribution. (In any event, the salary will be subject to garnishment.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This act has no specific rules for determining the fate or effect of a charging order when the partnership undergoes a merger, conversion, interest exchange, or domestication under Article 11. In the proper circumstances, such an organic change might trigger an order under Subsection (b)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —The phrase “that distributions under the charging order will not pay the judgment debt within a reasonable period of time” comes from case law.
       See, e.g., Nigri v. Lotz
    , 453 S.E.2d 780, 783 (Ga. Ct. App. 1995);
       <i>
        Stewart v. Lanier Park Med. Office Bldg., Ltd.
       </i>
       , 578 S.E.2d 572, 574 (Ga. Ct. App. 2003) (“Judicial sale may be appropriate where … it is apparent that distributions under the charging order will not pay the judgment debt within a reasonable amount of time.”). A purchaser at a foreclosure sale obtains only the very limited rights of a transferee under Section 503 and is in some ways more vulnerable and less powerful than the holder of a charging order. After foreclosure and sale, Subsection (b) no longer applies. More generally, the court is no longer involved in the matter. For the vulnerability of a transferee, see Sections 503(a)(3) comment; 107(b), comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —This provision allows the judgment debtor to end the charging order without need for a hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —Traditionally, charging order provisions referred to the possibility of “redeeming” an interest subject to a charging order. That usage was confusing, leaving several important questions unanswered. This act substitutes a far simpler approach, contemplating the partnership or its partners buying the underlying judgment and thereby dispensing with any interference the judgment creditor might seek to inflict on the partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       In many circumstances, buying the judgment is superior to the mechanism provided by this subsection, because: (i) this subsection requires full satisfaction of the underlying judgment; and (ii) the partnership or the other partners might be able to buy the judgment for less than face value. On the other hand, this subsection operates without need for the judgment creditor’s consent, so it remains a valuable protection in the event a judgment creditor seeks to do mischief to the partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a partnership’s decision to invoke this subsection is “ordinary course” or “outside the ordinary course,” Section 401(k), depends on the circumstances. However, the involvement of this subsection does not by itself make the decision “outside the ordinary course.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f)
       </b>
       —This subsection preserves otherwise applicable exemptions but does not create any.
       In re Foos
    , 405 B.R. 604, 609 (Bankr. N. D. Ohio 2009) (interpreting the comparable provision in UPA (1997) and stating that “it is clear that [the provision] does not create an exemption”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (g)
       </b>
       —This subsection does not override Uniform Commercial Code, Article 9, which may provide different remedies for a secured creditor acting in that capacity. A secured creditor with a judgment might decide to proceed under Article 9 alone, under this section alone, or under both Article 9 and this section. In the last-mentioned circumstance, the constraints of this section would apply to the charging order but not to the Article 9 remedies.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection is not intended to prevent a court from effecting a “reverse pierce” where appropriate. In a reverse pierce, the court conflates the entity and its owner to hold the entity liable for a debt of the owner.

    , 799 A.2d 298, 312 (Conn. App. Ct. 2002) (approving a reverse pierce where a judgment debtor had established a partnership in a patent attempt to frustrate the judgment creditor),

        overruled on other grounds by, Robinson v. Coughlin
       </i>

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section mostly states default rules, which the partnership agreement may vary. However, it makes no sense to vary some of the rules –
       e.g.
    , that the death of a partner who is an individual does
       <i>
        not
       </i>
       cause the individual’s dissociation as a partner, Paragraph (7)(A), or that a entity remains a partner even
       <i>
        after
       </i>
       the existence of the entity has terminated, Paragraph (10).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (1)
       </b>
       —Partnership agreements often require notice of dissociation to be in writing and to specify the effective date of the dissociation. The partnership cannot eliminate the power of a partner to dissociate by express will, Section 110(c)(9), but can eliminate the right and thereby make the dissociation wrongful.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (3)
       </b>
       —General partnership agreements often provide for “no cause” expulsion, and courts differ somewhat in how they approach such provisions.
       Compare Gelder Med. Grp. v. Webber
    , 363 N.E.2d 573, 576 (N.Y. 1977),
       <i>
        with Winston &amp; Strawn v. Nosal
       </i>
       , 664 N.E.2d 239, 245 (Ill. App. Ct. 1996).
       <i>
        See also
       </i>
       the comment to Section 409(d) (stating and explaining the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (4)(B)
       </b>
       —This paragraph permits expulsion when a partner no longer has any “skin in the game.” Although Article 7 provides for the buy-out of a dissociated partner’s transferable interest, in this context the dissociated partner has no transferable interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (5)
       </b>
       —For examples of conduct warranting an expulsion order, see
       Della Ratta v. Dyas
    , 961 A.2d 629, 642 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2008), aff'd, 996 A.2d 382 (Md. 2010) (noting that “[t]he trial court expressly found that [two major capital] calls ‘were issued in bad faith’… [and the] court also found that, ‘[by] another improper accounting movement” in [the partnership], $580,000 was taken ‘for executive office expenses which was improper’”);
       <i>
        Brennan v. Brennan Assocs.
       </i>
       , 977 A.2d 107, 117–18 (Conn. 2009) (referring to the expelled partner’s “moral turpitude, criminal fraud, and failure to be honest in court as to the extent of his criminal wrongdoing” as well as “his baseless claims of fraud” against a fellow partner; stating “he has rung the bell and it cannot be unrung”).
      </p>
      <p>
       For an analysis that helps distinguish Paragraph (5)(C) from Paragraphs (5)(A) and (B),
       see All Saints University of Medicine Aruba v. Chilana
    , A-2628-09T1, 2012 WL 6652510, at *15 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. Dec. 24, 2012) (interpreting predecessor law and noting that the “not reasonably practicable standard” does not require a showing of wrongful conduct).
       <i>
        Cf. Dunnagan v. Watson
       </i>
       , 204 S.W.3d 30, 40 (Tex. Ct. App. 2006) (same issue in the context of dissolution).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where grounds exist for both dissociation and dissolution, a court has the discretion to choose between the alternatives.
       Robertson v. Jacobs Cattle Co.
    , 830 N.W.2d 191, 201–02 (Neb. 2013). “[T]here is no textual basis for imposing a higher burden of proof for dissociation than dissolution.”
       <i>
        Brennan v. Brennan Assocs.
       </i>
       , 977 A.2d 107, 121 (Conn. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement cannot vary the stated grounds for expulsion, Section 105(c)(10), but can choose an alternate forum –
       e.g.
    , arbitration.
       <i>
        Compare
       </i>
       Section 801(a)(4) (containing analogous grounds for dissolution by court order),
       <i>
        with
       </i>
       Section 105(c)(11) (making the Section 701(a)(4) grounds non-waivable).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (6)(A)
       </b>
       —This provision is subject to bankruptcy law.
       See, e.g.
    ,
       11 U.S.C.A. § 365(e) (invalidating “ipso facto” clauses, subject to some exceptions).

      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraphs (8) and (9)
       </b>
       —A change in trustee or personal representative does not cause dissociation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (11)(A)
       </b>
       —If a partnership disappears as part of a merger, no person can continue as a partner of the partnership. When the merger takes effect, those partners of the disappearing company are perforce dissociated. Depending on the plan of merger, those persons may become partners of a surviving partnership. In those circumstances, the merger will have dissociated them from one partnership and admitted them into partnership in the surviving partnership.
       See
    Sections 402(b)(2) and 1126(a)(10).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (11)(B)
       </b>
       —It is possible for a plan of merger to “shuffle the equity” of the surviving entity, even to the extent of “taking out” some or all of the owners of the surviving entity. A reverse triangular merger involving a partnership as the surviving entity would dissociate all the partners of the partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (13)
       </b>
       —By definition, a partnership that converts ceases to be a partnership.
       See
    Section 1146. Thus, when the plan of conversion takes effect, all the partners of the converted entity are dissociated from that entity. In many cases, those persons will all be owners of the converted entity. In some cases, the conversion will “shuffle the equity” and “take out” some of the partners of the converting partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (14)
       </b>
       —Domestication does not by itself dissociate a partner, because the domesticated entity remains both a partnership and “the same entity without interruption as the domesticating company.” Section 1156(a)(1)(B). However, an “equity shuffle” could dissociate a partner.

        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —A general partnership is a voluntary association,
       see
    Section 105(c)(9), and voluntary in this context means “proceeding from the will or from one’s own choice or consent … having power of free choice.”
       Black’s Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009). Necessarily therefore, a general partner always has the power to dissociate by express will. Accordingly, the partnership agreement cannot vary this subsection except to the extent of requiring the notice of dissociation to be in writing. Section 105(c)(9).
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “rightfully or wrongfully” reflects the distinction between a partner’s
       power
    to withdraw in contravention of the partnership agreement and a partner’s
       <i>
        right
       </i>
       to do so. Thus, although a partner cannot be enjoined from exercising the power to dissociate, the dissociation may be wrongful under Subsection (b).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection list exhaustively (“only if”) the dissociations that are “wrongful.” The label has three consequences:
      </p>
      <p>
       • under Subsection (c) liability for resulting damages, which, under Section 701(c), may be offset against the amount of the buyout price due to the partner under Section 701(a);
      </p>
      <p>
       • under Section 701(h) postponement of payment of the buyout price until the term expires or the undertaking is completed; and
      </p>
      <p>
       • under Section 804, exclusion from the winding up process, if the dissociation results in dissolution of the partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection states a default rule. The partnership agreement can expand the list (
    e.g.
    , by making wrongful a dissociation that beaches the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing). In theory, the partnership agreement can provide for liquidated damages (subject to the requirements of contract law) and, in theory, can also shrink or even eliminate the list of wrongful dissociations.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(2)(A)
       </b>
       —This paragraph protects a partner’s reactive withdrawal from a term partnership after the premature departure of another partner, such as the partnership’s rainmaker or main supplier of capital, under the same circumstances that may result in the dissolution of the partnership under Section 801(2)(A). Under that provision, a term partnership is dissolved ninety days after the bankruptcy, incapacity, death (or similar dissociation of a partner that is an entity), or wrongful dissociation of any partner, unless a majority in interest of the remaining partners agree to continue the partnership. Under this provision, a partner’s exercise of the right of withdrawal by express will under those circumstances is rendered “rightful,” even if the partnership is continued by others, and does not expose the withdrawing partner to damages for wrongful dissociation under Section 602(c).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(2)(C)
       </b>
       —This provision refers to Section 601(6), which involves
       inter alia
    dissociation on account of bankruptcy, which in turn is subject to bankruptcy law.
       <i>
        See, e.g.
       </i>
       ,
       11 U.S.C.A. § 365(e) (invalidating “ipso facto” clauses, subject to some exceptions).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —A partner who prematurely dissociates from a partnership for an agreed term or undertaking risks liability for any resulting damages. For example, the partnership might incur substantial expenses in replacing the general partner’s expertise, reputation, or creditworthiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       In effect, this subsection equates wrongful dissociation with breach of contract. Accordingly, courts should look to contract law to determine what consequential damages are recoverable.

    , 9 Exch. 341 (1854);
       Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 351 (1981);

        Subsection (b)(1)
       </b>
       —A person’s dissociation as a partner ends immediately the person’s right to participate in the management of the business, unless the dissociation results in dissolution of the partnership.
       See
    Section 802(c) (“A person whose dissociation as a partner resulted in dissolution may participate in winding up as if still a partner, unless the dissociation was wrongful.”).

       <b>
        Subsection (b)(2)
       </b>
       —Unless a person’s dissociation as a partner results in dissolution and the person participates in winding up, Section 802(c), this provision establishes a dividing line, separating out “matters arising and events occurring after the person’s dissociation.” If the partnership has continuing projects with clients, ongoing relationships with clients, or both, the dividing line requires special attention with regard to non-competition and partnership opportunities duties.
       See
    Section 409(b)(1), (3).

      <p>
       Disputes involving law firms have generated much of the relevant case law.
       See, e.g., Meehan v. Shaughnessy
    , 535 N.E.2d 1255, 1257 (Mass. 1989);

        Jewel v. Boxer
       </i>
       , 156 Cal. App. 3d 171, 175 (Cal. Ct. App. 1984). To a large extent a well-drawn partnership agreement can delineate the parties’ respective rights and responsibilities and thereby avoid problems. However, if the partnership becomes insolvent, the bankruptcy court may well scrutinize the partners’
       <i>

       arrangements.
       <i>

       This provision does not determine the effect of a person’s dissociation as a partner on the person’s future obligations or rights under the partnership agreement. Some contractual obligations typically extend beyond dissociation –
       e.g.
    , non-competition agreements, buyout arrangements. To the extent provisions of the partnership agreement continue to apply, the common law obligation of good faith continues to apply as well.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Article 7 originated in UPA (1997) and provides for the buyout of the interest of a person dissociated as a partner if the dissociation does not result in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership’s business under Article 8.
       See
    Section 603(a). If there is no dissolution, the remaining partners have a right to continue the business and the person dissociated as a partner has a right to be bought out. These rights can, of course, be varied in the partnership agreement.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 105. A person dissociated as a partner has a continuing relationship with the partnership and third parties as provided in Sections 603(b), 702, and 703.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 408(e) (access to information of person dissociated as a partner).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rules in this section are merely default rules. The partners may, in the partnership agreement, fix the method or formula for determining the buyout price and all of the other terms and conditions of the buyout right. Indeed, the very right to a buyout itself may be modified, although a provision providing for a complete forfeiture would probably not be enforceable.
       See
    Section 119 (Supplemental Principles of Law).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides that, if a person’s dissociation as a partner does not result in a windup of the business, the partnership shall cause the interest of the dissociating partner to be purchased for a buyout price determined pursuant to Subsection (b). The buyout is mandatory, unless the partnership provides otherwise. The “cause to be purchased” language is intended to accommodate a purchase by the partnership, one or more of the remaining partners, or a third party.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides how the “buyout price” is to be determined. The terms “fair market value” or “fair value” were not used because they are often considered terms of art having a special meaning depending on the context, such as in tax or corporate law. “Buyout price” was a new term in UPA (1997). Under Subsection (b), the buyout price is the amount that would have been distributable to the dissociating partner under Section 807(b) if, on the date of dissociation, the assets of the partnership were sold at a price equal to the greater of liquidation value or going concern value without the departing partner. Liquidation value is not intended to mean distress sale value. Under general principles of valuation, the hypothetical selling price in either case should be the price that a willing and informed buyer would pay a willing and informed seller, with neither being under any compulsion to deal. The notion of a minority discount in determining the buyout price is negated by valuing the business as a going concern. Other discounts, such as for a lack of marketability or the loss of a key partner, may be appropriate, however. For a case applying the concept, see
       Fotouhi v. Mansdorf
    , 427 B.R. 798, 803–05 (Bankr. N.D. Cal. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the buyout price is based on the value of the business at the time of dissociation, the partnership must pay interest on the amount due from the date of dissociation until payment to compensate the dissociating partner for the use of his interest in the firm. Under UPA (1914) § 42, the person dissociated as a partner could elect a share of the profits in lieu of interest. UPA (1997) eliminated that option.

       UPA (1914) § 38(2)(c)(II) provides that the good will of the business not be considered in valuing a wrongfully dissociating partner’s interest. UPA (1997) implicitly rejected that approach. Under this section, unless the partnership’s goodwill is damaged by the wrongful dissociation, the value of the wrongfully dissociating partner’s interest will include any goodwill value of the partnership. If the firm’s goodwill is damaged, the amount of the damages suffered by the partnership and the remaining partners will be offset against the buyout price.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides that the partnership may offset against the buyout price all amounts owing by the person dissociated as a partner to the partnership, whether or not presently due, including any damages for wrongful dissociation under Section 602(c). This rule has the effect of accelerating payment of amounts not yet due from the former partner to the partnership, including a long-term loan by the partnership to the former partner. Where appropriate, the amounts not yet due should be discounted to present value. A dissociating partner, on the other hand, is not entitled to an add-on for amounts owing to him by the partnership. Thus, a departing partner who has made a long-term loan to the partnership must wait for repayment, unless the terms of the loan agreement provide for acceleration upon dissociation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership’s right of setoff does not limit the amount of damages the partnership may claim for the wrongful dissociation and does not alter any other amounts owed to the partnership. Those amounts may result in a net sum due to the partnership from the person dissociated as a partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —Following the rule stated in UPA (1914) § 38, this section requires the partnership to indemnify a person dissociated as a partner against all partnership liabilities, whether incurred before or after the dissociation, except those incurred by the person under Section 702. The rationale for covering post-dissociation liabilities is the fact of dissociation; the person dissociated as a partner is no longer a co-owner of the enterprise. As for pre-existing liabilities, the determination of the buyout price necessarily assumes that these liabilities will be paid. Thus, in effect the person’s share of these liabilities has already been paid through the valuation process.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —If a person dissociated as a partner makes a written demand for payment and no agreement for the purchase of the interest is reached within 120 days after the demand, the partnership must pay, or cause to be paid, in cash the amount it estimates to be the buyout price, adjusted for any offsets allowed and accrued interest. Thus, the person dissociated as a partner will receive in cash within 120 days of dissociation the undisputed minimum value of the person’s partnership interest. If the person claims that the buyout price should be higher, suit may thereafter be brought as provided in Subsection (i) to have the amount of the buyout price determined by the court. This is similar to the procedure for determining the value of dissenting shareholders’ shares under the Model Business Corporation Act §§ 13.20–13.28.
      </p>
      <p>
       The “cause to be paid” language of Subsection (a) is repeated here to permit either the partnership, one or more of the continuing partners, or a third-party purchaser to tender payment of the estimated amount due.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f)
       </b>
       —Under this subsection, when deferred payment is authorized in the case of a wrongfully dissociating partner, a written offer stating the amount the partnership estimates to be the purchase price should be tendered within the 120-day period, even though actual payment of the amount may be deferred, possibly for many years.
       See
    the comment to Subsection (h). The dissociated partner is entitled to know at the time of dissociation what amount the remaining partners think is due, including the estimated amount of any damages allegedly caused by the partner’s wrongful dissociation that may be offset against the buyout price.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (g)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides that the payment of the estimated price (or tender of a written offer under Subsection (f)) by the partnership must be accompanied by: (i) a statement of the partnership’s assets and liabilities as of the date of the person’s dissociation as a partner; (ii) the latest available balance sheet and income statement, if the partnership maintains such financial statements; (iii) an explanation of how the estimated amount of the payment was calculated; and (iv) a written notice that the payment will be in full satisfaction of the partnership’s buyout obligation unless the person dissociated as a partner commences an action to determine the price within 120 days of the notice. Subsection (g) is based in part on the dissenters’ rights provisions of Model Business Corporation Act Section 13.25(b).
      </p>
      <p>
       Those disclosures should serve to identify and narrow substantially the items of dispute between the person dissociated as a partner and the partnership over the valuation of the partnership interest. The disclosures will also serve to pin down the parties as to their claims of partnership assets and values and as to the existence and amount of all known liabilities. Lastly, the disclosures will force the remaining partners to consider thoughtfully the difficult and important questions as to the appropriate method of valuation under the circumstances, and in particular, whether they should use going concern or liquidation value. Simply getting that information on the record in a timely fashion should increase the likelihood of a negotiated resolution of the parties’ differences during the 120-day period within which the person dissociated as a partner must bring suit.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (h)
       </b>
       —UPA (1914) § 38 contemplates a buyout in the context of the partnership business being continued after a partner’s wrongful dissociation has (inevitably) caused dissolution. UPA (1914) § 38(2)(c) entitles the wrongfully dissociating partner to have the buyout price “paid to him in cash, or the payment secured by bond approved by the court.” UPA (1997) took a different approach, which the Harmonization Project did not change. Under Subsection (h), a wrongfully dissociating partner is not entitled to receive any portion of the buyout price before the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, unless the person dissociated as a partner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that earlier payment will not cause undue hardship to the business of the partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (i)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides that a person dissociated as a partner may maintain an action against the partnership to determine the buyout price, any offsets, or other terms of the purchase obligation. The action must be commenced within 120 days after the partnership tenders payment of the amount it estimates to be due or, if deferred payment is authorized, its written offer. This provision creates a 120-day “cooling off” period. It also allows the parties an opportunity to negotiate their differences after disclosure by the partnership of its financial statements and other required information.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the partnership fails to tender payment of the estimated amount due (or a written offer, if deferred payment is authorized), the person dissociated as a partner has one year after written demand for payment in which to commence suit.

      <p>
       A person’s dissociation as a partner ends immediately the person’s actual authority to act for the partnership, unless the dissociation results in a dissolution and winding up of the business of the partnership.
       See
    Section 603(b)(1). However, the person’s apparent authority may linger.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not affect a person’s power to bind a partnership in another capacity –
       e.g.
    , as an employee with actual authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection codifies and constrains the lingering apparent authority of a person dissociated as a partner. The constraint is in the phrase “only if.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The provision applies until the partnership dissolves or under Article 11 ceases to be governed by this act. Once a partnership dissolves, Section 804 applies.
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to authority of a person dissociated as a partner to transfer partnership real property, Section 303(e) provides that third parties are deemed to have knowledge of a limitation on the person’s authority to transfer real property held in the partnership name upon the proper recording of a statement containing such a limitation. Section 704(b) provides that a statement of dissociation operates as a limitation on the person’s authority for the purposes of Section 303(e). Thus, a properly recorded statement of dissociation provides, immediately upon recording, constructive knowledge of the lack of authority of a person dissociated as a partner to transfer real property held in the partnership name.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(1)
       </b>
       —It is the statutory apparent authority from Section 301 which lingers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)(A)
       </b>
       —In any event, any lingering apparent authority ends two years after the dissociation.
      </p>

       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)(B)
       </b>
       —A person might have notice under Section 103(d)(2)(A) (statement of dissociation) as well as under Section 103(b)(1) (person “ha[ving] reason to know the fact from all the facts known to the person at the time in question”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —The liability stated in this subsection is not exhaustive. For example, if a person dissociated as a partner causes a partnership to be bound under Subsection (a) and, due to a guaranty, some other person—not a partner nor a person dissociated as a partner—is liable on the resulting obligation, that other person may have a claim under other law against the person dissociated as a partner.

       Section 705 originated in UPA (1997) and is an edited version of UPA (1914) § 41(10). The section merely protects a person dissociated as a person from liability in case the partnership continues to use the person’s name. Whether a partnership has a right to the continued use is a matter for the partnership agreement; this act states no rule on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the partnership agreement does not expressly address the issue, custom may imply a term.
       See Gignilliat v. Gignilliat, Savitz &amp; Bettis, L.L.P.

Heretofore, the basis has been the taking for granted that the deceased partner would consent. Hereafter, it is presumed, unless proven otherwise, that the deceased partner consented to the continued use of his or her name in the partnership’s name.”).

        Official Comment.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       “Dissolution” has been a term of art in the law of unincorporated business organizations
       since at least the time of Roman law.
       Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Law of Partnership § 266, at 408 (2d ed. 1850) (“The Roman law … declared, that partnership might
       be dissolved in various ways … .”). Dissolution does not end a partnership’s existence but rather
       changes the purpose of that existence: “A dissolved partnership shall wind up its business and… the partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up.” Section 802(a). The partnership may, but need not, file a statement of dissolution. Section 802(b)(2)(A). The
       partnership terminates when winding up is complete. The partnership may, but need not, file a
       statement of termination. Section 802(b)(2)(F).
      </p>
      <p>
       UPA (1914) took a strictly aggregate approach to dissolution; under UPA (1914) § 29, the
       departure of any partner under any circumstances inevitably caused the partnership to dissolve. A
       partnership agreement had no power to avoid this result, although many partnership agreements
       purported to do so. A partnership agreement could provide for the continuation of the partnership
       business in a successor partnership, UPA (1914) § 38(2)(b), but that approach was often
       problematic.
       See
    the comment to Section 201(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       UPA (1997) fundamentally changed this aspect of the law of general partnerships, making
       the partnership entity much more durable than the UPA (1914) aggregate. For example, expelling
       a partner does not cause the partnership to dissolve, even if the partnership is at-will. Section
       801(1). More generally, the grounds for dissolution stated in Section 801 are exhaustive, unless
       the partnership agreement states otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given this act’s built-in transfer restrictions, Section 503, increasing the partnership’s
       durability necessarily decreases each partner’s exit rights. Under UPA (1914), each partner has a
       non-waivable power to exit the enterprise; dissociation inevitably causes dissolution, which in
       most instances will lead to a buyout of the dissociating partner, subject to any damages for
       wrongful dissolution. UPA (1914) § 38. Eliminating that power creates a risk of “lock-in.”
      </p>
      <p>
       UPA (1997) addressed the lock-in issue through UPA (1997) § 701. When a person
       dissociates as a partner, whether rightfully or wrongfully, the partnership is obligated to buy out
       the person’s interest. Note, however, that Section 701, like UPA (1997) § 701, is a default rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except for Paragraphs 4 and 5, this section comprises default rules. Paragraphs 4 and 5
       are mandatory only with regard to the stated grounds for dissolution.
       See
    the comment to Section
       105(c)(11). Variations to the statutory causes of dissolution are commonplace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 803 permits rescission of dissolution in some circumstances. In some
       circumstances, an amendment to the partnership agreement might avert dissolution –
       e.g.
    , by
       revising an agreed-upon deadline for selling the partnership assets and winding up the business.
       A retroactive amendment may also be possible.
       <i>

        Inc.
       </i>
       , CV082220PSGPJWX, 2009 WL 279080, at *5–6 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 3, 2009) (giving effect to
       an amendment that retroactively eliminated an event of dissolution; noting that UPA (1997)
       § 802(b) permitted a partnership to rescind dissolution).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Harmonization Project added Paragraph 6 but otherwise made no significant changes
       to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (1)
       </b>
       —This paragraph: (i) recognizes the power of any partner in a partnership
       at will to dissolve the partnership at any time “by express will”; and (ii) provides that a partner
       who has already been dissociated under some other provision of this section lacks the power to
       dissolve the partnership. The latter proposition seems self-evident; a person dissociated as a
       partner is no longer a partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (2)
       </b>
       —This paragraph provides three ways in which a term partnership may be
       dissolved before the expiration of the term.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (2)(A)
       </b>
       —This provision: (i) originated in UPA (1997); (ii) helps make the
       partnership entity more durable; (iii) protects the remaining partners where the dissociating
       partner is crucial to the successful continuation of the business; and (iv) reverses the approach of
       UPA (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under UPA (1914), any dissociation dissolves the partnership, and unanimous consent of
       the remaining partners to continue the business. Thus each partner has the right to cause
       liquidation.
       See
    UPA (1914) § 38(2)(b). Under this act, a term partnership is more durable.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person’s dissociation as a partner by death or otherwise under Section 601(6) to (10) or
       wrongful dissociation under Section 602(b), makes a term partnership
       susceptible
    to dissolution.
       If within ninety days after the dissociation at least half of the remaining partners express their
       will to dissolve the partnership, the partnership dissolves. Section 601(6) to (10) pertain, respectively, to a partner’s bankruptcy or similar financial impairment (6); a partner’s death or
       incapacity (7); the distribution by a trust-partner of its entire transferable interest (8); the
       distribution by an estate-partner of its entire transferable interest; and the termination of an
       entity-partner (10).
      </p>
      <p>
       During the same ninety-day window, Section 602(b)(2)(A) permits each remaining
       partner to withdraw rightfully by express will. A partner does not express a desire to withdraw
       solely by reason of voting for or consenting to the winding up of the partnership business.
       However, the converse is true: “[A] person’s rightful dissociation pursuant to Section
       602(b)(2)(A) constitutes the expression of that partner's consent to wind up the partnership
       business.” Section 801(2)(A).
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A term partnership has seven partners, and one of the partners dissociates by
       dying before the end of the term. Section 601(7). The partnership will dissolve if within
       ninety days after the dissociation three of the remaining five partners affirmatively vote
       or consent to dissolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Same facts, except the partner dissociates in breach of the partnership
       agreement. Same result.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Same facts, except that the partner is “a person that … is acting as a partner
       by virtue of being a trustee of … a trust, [and] the trust’s entire transferable interest in
       the partnership [has been] distributed. Section 601(8). Same result.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (2)(B)
       </b>
       —This provision states that a term partnership may be dissolved and
       wound up at any time by the express will of all the partners. The provision merely reflects the
       general rule that the partnership agreement may override the statutory default rules and that the
       partnership agreement, like any contract, can be amended at any time by unanimous consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (2)(C)
       </b>
       —This rule is inherent in the concept of a partnership for a specified
       term or undertaking. This provision must be read in conjunction with Section 411. Under Section
       411(a), if the partners continue the business after the expiration of the term or the completion of
       the undertaking, the partnership will be treated as a partnership at will. Moreover, if the partners
       continue the business without any settlement or liquidation of the partnership, under Section
       411(b) they are presumed to have agreed that the partnership will continue, despite the lack of a
       formal agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (3)
       </b>
       —The partners can avoid the effects of this paragraph either by amending
       159 the partnership agreement before dissolution occurs or using Section 803 to rescind dissolution.
       A retroactive amendment may also be possible.
       See Kindred Ltd. P'ship v. Screen Actors Guild,
       Inc.
    , CV082220PSGPJWX, 2009 WL 279080, at *5–6 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 3, 2009) (giving effect to an amendment that retroactively eliminated an event of dissolution; noting that UPA (1997)
       § 802(b) permitted a partnership to rescind dissolution).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (4)
       </b>
       —The partnership agreement cannot vary the stated grounds for
       dissolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (4)(A)
       </b>
       —The “all or substantially all” proviso is intended to avoid dissolution
       for insubstantial or innocent regulatory violations.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (4)(B)–(D)
       </b>
       —The Virginia Supreme Court has referred to “these statutory
       bases for judicial dissolution as the economic purpose test, the partner conduct test, and the
       business operations test, respectively.”
       Russell Realty Assocs. v. Russell
    , 724 S.E.2d 690, 693
       (Va. 2012). These tests somewhat overlap and are often pled together.

      </p>
      <p>
       Some courts have held that, if the trial court finds grounds for dissolution under one or
       more of these provisions, that court has no power to order a lesser remedy, such as a buyout.
       Pankratz Farms, Inc. v. Pankratz
    , 95 P.3d 671, 679–80 (Mont. 2004) (so holding even though: (i)
       “judicial dissolution of the Partnership would trigger significant adverse tax consequences to all
       the parties involved, including Marvin [who commenced the action seeking dissolution”; and (ii)
       “Marvin [had] requested monetary damages as an alternative to dissolution”);

       not reasonably practical to carry on the partnership, the court has no discretion to deny a
       partner’s application to dissolve it.”).

       Russell Realty Assocs. v. Russell
    , 724 S.E.2d 690, 694 (Va. 2012). The
       provision’s history substantiates the first point (not by itself sufficient).

       partners’ expectations in a start-up or tax shelter situation, in which case ‘book’ or ‘tax’ losses do
       not signify business failure.”).

      <p>
       Under the default rules of this act, dissolution does not change governance arrangements.
       However, dissolution does change the context for determining whether a matter is in or outside
       “the ordinary course of business of [the] partnership.” Section 401(k). In addition, dissolution
       triggers a default rule entitling each partner to “reasonable compensation for services rendered in
       winding up the business of the partnership.” Section 401(j).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 804 governs the post-dissolution power of a partner to bind the partnership, and
       Section 805 governs the “liability after dissolution of partner and person dissociated as general
       partner.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —The particular circumstances determine how long winding up may
       continue without giving “good cause” for court intervention under Section 802(e). There is no
       “hard and fast” rule.
       See, e.g., Mathis v. Meyeres
    , 574 P.2d 447, 450 (Alaska 1978) (stating “we
       are aware of [no authority] requiring that deadlines be set in the winding up of a partnership”);

       Partnership Law contemplates that dissolved partnerships may continue in business for a short,
       long or indefinite period of time.”) (quoting

       “Winding up usually entails the time necessary for the partners to finish old business,
       collect and pay debts, and finally distribute remaining assets to the partners.”
       Gibson v. Deuth
    ,
       270 N.W.2d 632, 635 (Iowa 1978). “Generally the best interests of the partnership will be served
       by winding up the partnership affairs as quickly as possible.”

       </i>
       , 856 P.2d 536, 540

       appropriate but necessary.

        Lebanon Trotting Ass'n v. Battista
       </i>
       , 306 N.E.2d 769, 772 (Ohio Ct.
       App. 1972) (“[I]f the only means of availing the partners of the benefit of the value of the lease
       would be to continue to operate under such lease until its expiration, then such operation may
       continue as part of the winding up of the partnership affairs after dissolution. It is not necessary
       that a partnership, in the absence of the consent of all the partners, abandon a valuable asset upon
       dissolution merely because it may have no ready market value, but the value of such asset can
       continue to inure to the benefit of the partners through the continuation of the partnership after dissolution.”).

       <b>
        Subsection (c)

       —This provision applies only to “[a] partner whose [rightful] dissociation
       resulted in dissolution.”
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Partner A dissociates from the Killarney Company (“Killarney”), a general
       partnership. Partner A’s dissociation does not result in dissolution, and, per the Killarney
       partnership agreement, Partner A’s transferable interest is being redeemed over five years.
       One year after Partner A’s dissociation, Partner B dissociates rightfully, and dissolution
       results. Partner B may participate in Killarney’s winding up; Partner A may not.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Partner A wrongfully dissociates from Killarney, and the dissociation results
       in the dissolution of Killarney. Partner A may not participate in winding up.
      </p>
      <p>
       A partner’s duties and obligation under Section 409 extend to winding up. Section
       603(b)(2). However, under Section 409(b)(3), each partner’s duty not to compete ends when the

       The Harmonization Project added this section, replacing UPA (1997) § 802(b) (permitting
       the partners to “waive the right to have the partnership’s business wound up and the partnership

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section provides the “power to bind” rules applicable once dissolution occurs. The
       section originated in UPA (1997), which significantly departed from the approach of UPA
       (1914). The Harmonization Project revised this section to conform to ULPA (2001). However,
       the revisions are essentially stylistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, this section parallels Section 702 (power to bind of a person dissociated as
       partner when dissolution does not result from the dissociation). However, one significant
       difference exists. Section 702(a)(2)(A) contains a provision analogous to a statute of repose. A
       166 person’s power to bind the partnership terminates two years after the date of dissociation.
       Subsection (b) contains a comparable provision, but Subsection (a) does not.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsections (a) and (b)
       </b>
       —Subsection (a) states the power-to-bind rules for persons still
       partners when dissolution occurs. Subsection (b) pertains to persons dissociated before
       dissolution, including a partner whose dissociation results in dissolution.
       Compare
    Section 804,
       <i>
        with
       </i>
       Section 802(c) (stating that as an
       <i>
        inter se
       </i>
       matter a person whose rightful dissociation results
       in dissolution may participate in winding up “as if still a partner.”).

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(1)
       </b>
       —This paragraph states a rule of inherent agency power.
       See
    Restatement (Second) of Agency § 8A (defining “inherent agency power” as “the power of
       an agent which is derived not from authority, apparent authority or estoppel, but solely from the
       agency relation and exists for the protection of persons harmed by or dealing with a servant or
       other agent”). Thus, a partner might act without actual or apparent authority and still bind the
       partnership. The partnership agreement cannot change the stated rule because the rule pertains to
       the rights under this act of third parties.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 105(c)(17).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a partner’s words or conduct trigger this paragraph, thereby binding the partnership,
       and the partner lacks the actual authority to do so, the partner breaches an agent’s duty to act
       within authority, and is liable to the partnership for any resulting damages.
       Restatement (Third) of Agency § 8.09(1) (“An agent has a duty to take action only within the scope of the
       agent’s actual authority”). The partner might also be liable for breach of the partnership
       agreement.

       (ii) Paragraph 2 replicates Subsection (a) of this section, which states the post-dissolution power
       to bind of a person is still a partner.

       For a person dissociated as a partner to bind a dissolved partnership:

       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection is non-waivable as to creditors who are not partners.
       See
    Section 105(c)(17) (stating that the partnership agreement may not “restrict the rights under
       this [act] of a person other than a partner”). However, if a creditor is willing, a dissolved
       partnership may certainly make agreements with the creditor specifying the terms under which
       the partnership will “discharge its obligations” to the creditor. If under Section 306(a) one or
       more partners are also liable on a partnership obligation, any agreement between the partnership and the creditor should take in account Section 703(d).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —For the most part, this subsection states default rules. For example,
       partnership agreements often provide for different distribution rights upon liquidation than
       during operations. However, distributions under this subsection (or otherwise under the
       partnership agreement) are subject to Section 504 (charging orders). As to the extent the
       partnership agreement can be amended to affect the distribution rights of persons already
       transferees, see Section 107(b).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This section applies obligation by obligation, because a person—
    qua
    partner or person dissociated as a partner—is required to contribute to the partnership to satisfy a
       partnership obligation only if, when the obligation was incurred: (i) the person was a partner; and
       (ii) the partnership was not an LLP.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 306(b), (c). As for when a partnership obligation
       is incurred, see Section 306(b) and (c), comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The allocation of contribution obligations parallels the default rule stated in Section
       401(a) (providing that, “except in the case of a limited liability partnership, [each partner] is
       chargeable with a share of the partnership losses in proportion to the partner’s share of the
       profits”). The partnership agreement can change the allocation
       inter se
    partners and persons
       dissociated as partners but cannot prejudice the rights of non-partner creditors.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: The A-B Partnership (the “Partnership”) owes Creditor $150, an obligation
       incurred when Partners A and B were the only partners, sharing distributions equally, and
       the Partnership was not an LLP. The Partnership has no funds to pay Creditor. Although
       Subsection (c)(1) would require Partners A and B each to contribute equally (
    i.e.
    , $75),
       the A-B Partnership Agreement provides that Partner A has the entire contribution
       obligation and Partner B has none. As between Partners A and B, Partner A is obligated to
       contribute $150 and Partner B nothing. However, as to Creditor, Partner B still has a
       contribution obligation of $75.
      </p>
      <p>
       This formal distinction will have practical consequences only if A does not
       contribute the full $150. Also, Creditor may have problems establishing standing.
       Cf.
    the
       comment to Section 407.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(2) and (3)
       </b>
       —These provisions are analogous to buy-sell provisions that:
       (i) provide that an owner’s effort to sell the ownership interest triggers an option to purchase
       allocated among all the other owners; (ii) make the option conditional on the entire interest being
       purchased; and (iii) provide for successive allocations to take up any previous allocations that
       were not unexercised.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —If a partnership has been a limited liability partnership throughout the
       partnership’s existence, this subsection is consistent with this act’s approach to loss sharing. If a
       partnership has been a limited liability partnership during only part of the partnership’s existence,
       the issue of loss sharing upon dissolution: (i) can be exceedingly complicated, varying radically
       depending on the circumstances; (ii) is therefore not amenable to a statutory “gap filler”; and (iii)
       thus should always be addressed in the partnership agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in case the partnership agreement does not address the issue, this act must
       provide a default rule.
       See
    the comment to Section 105(b) (“To the extent the partnership
       agreement does not determine an inter se matter, this act determines the matter.”). This
       subsection applies to fill the gap. This approach has the virtues of simplicity and certainty but in
       no way resembles what “typical” partners might agree if they were to consider the matter
       <i>
        ab initio
       </i>
       , especially if the partnership was never an LLP.

       A partner’s liability under Sections 306, 703 and 805 is vicarious liability—liability
       solely by status and solely for the “debts, obligations, and other liabilities of the partnership.” To
       the extent a claim pertaining to the underlying debt, obligation, or other liability is barred, a
       claim pertaining to the corresponding vicarious liability should likewise be barred.

      </h4>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —Every partnership governed by this act may become a limited liability
       partnership, and the necessary formalities are straightforward: approval of the decision by the
       partners and delivering to the filing office for filing a simple statement of qualification. A
       partnership becomes a limited liability partnership when the filing office files the statement of
       qualification and the statement takes effect. For the consequences of LLP status, see Section
       306(c), comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —In the default mode, becoming a limited liability partnership requires
       the agreement of all partners, because in the default mode amending the partnership agreement
       requires the affirmative vote or consent of all partners, Section 401(k) (stating the voting/consent
       requirement to amend the partnership agreement). The unanimous vote/consent default rule
       reflects the significance of the transformation
       inter se
    the partners.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       the comment to Section
       306(c) (Effect of LLP Status on Relations Inter Se the Partners).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the event a partnership agreement provides different quanta of consent for different
       matters, this subsection chooses (as a default rule) “the affirmative vote or consent necessary to
       amend those provisions” of “partnership agreement that expressly addresses obligations to
       contribute to the partnership.” This choice makes good sense, given the effect of LLP status on
       contribution obligations.
       See
    the comment to Section 306(c).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —Although a statement of qualification does not create a new entity,
       Section 201(b), the requirements stated here are comparable to the requirements for a certificate
       of formation for a limited liability company, ULLCA (2006) (Last Amended 2013), and a
       certificate of limited partnership, ULPA (2001) (Last Amended 2013). The liability shield—a
       privilege granted by state—justifies requiring an LLP to meet these requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —Under some early LLP statutes, an LLP’s failure to file an annual
       renewal ended LLP status and terminated the shield. This subsection eschews that draconian
       result. However, an LLP’s failure to file an annual/biennial report, Section 913, is grounds for
       administrative revocation.
       See
    Section 903(d);
       <i>
        see also
       </i>
       Section 306(c)(2) (stating that the
       liability shield continues despite dissolution).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither this subsection nor Section 306(c)(2) expressly addresses the effect of an LLP’s
       termination on the liability shield. However, neither logic nor policy supports the retroactive
       destruction of the shield.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f)
       </b>
       —The unanimity requirement for amending a statement of qualification is
       a default rule. The unanimity requirement for cancelling a statement of qualification is
       mandatory. Section 105(c)(13). The difference reflects the very different consequences of
       amendment and cancellation. Subsection (b) requires very little information in a statement of
       qualification and does not contemplate additional information.
       Compare
    Section 901(f),
       <i>
        with
       </i>
       ULLCA (2006) (Last Amended 2013) § 201(c) (authorizing a certificate of formation to include
       additional information)
       <i>
        and
       </i>
       ULPA (2001) (Last Amended 2013) § 201(c) (same). Therefore, an
       amendment can do no substantial harm to any partner’s interest. In contrast, cancelling a
       statement of qualification makes every partner vicariously liable for all partnership obligations.
       <i>
        Compare
       </i>
       Section 901(f),
       <i>
        with
       </i>
       Section 105(c)(14) (stating that the partnership agreement may not
       “vary the right of a partner to approve a merger, interest exchange, conversion, or domestication”
       the result of which is to impose vicarious liability on the person for the obligations of the
       resulting entity).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Many failures to comply with statutory requirements that may give rise to
       administrative revocation occur because of oversight or inadvertence and are usually
       corrected promptly when brought to the LLP’s attention. Subsections (b) and (c) therefore
       provide a mandatory notice by the filing office to each LLP whose statement of qualification
       is subject to administrative revocation and a sixty-day grace period following the notice
       before the statement of administrative revocation may be filed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In most instances, the issue whether a statement of qualification is subject to
       administrative revocation will not be controverted. If an LLP’s statement of qualification is
       administratively revoked, the statement is no longer in effect. However, the partnership may
       petition the filing office for reinstatement under Section 904 and, if reinstatement is denied,
       the company may appeal to the courts under Section 905.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a practical matter, administrative revocation permits the filing office to clear the
       record of “dead wood” and free up names.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the consequences for the partners can be quite serious. The liability shield
       remains effective for debts, liabilities, and other obligations incurred before revocation but
       disappears as to those incurred subsequently. A reinstated statement of qualification has
       retroactive effect generally, but exceptions can exist with regard to partnership obligations
       incurred before reinstatement.
       See
    Section 904(d)(3). For a discussion of when a partnership
       obligation is incurred, see the comment to Section 304(c) (The Temporal Nexus – When
       Claim Incurred).

       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —This rule follows from Section 201(b) (“A partnership is the same

       This section is analogous to statutes authorizing reinstatement following administrative
       dissolution.

       2013) § 812. In that context:
      </p>
      <p>
       • some states require that reinstatement be sought within two years of administrative
       dissolution;
      </p>
      <p>
       • other states provide a longer time, or do not impose any time limit;
      </p>
      <p>
       • imposing no limit risks abuse by unscrupulous people seeking to reinstate and
       appropriate for improper ends a dormant entity that has been abandoned by its owners;
       but
      </p>
      <p>
       • on the other hand, reinstatement is intended as a safety net for the inattentive and, if the
       deadline comes too soon, the safety net may be gone before the inattentive even learn
       that administrative dissolution has occurred.

       claim of having entered into a contract with the partnership, knowing of the revocation and
       relying on the vicarious liability of each partner. The exception could also preclude a reinstated
       LLP’s use of its own name.
       See
    Section 902(c)(2) (indirectly permitting an LLP to use the name

       Because the grounds for administrative revocation under Section 904 are limited and
       straight forward, it is unlikely there will be a dispute about whether a partnership has corrected
       the reasons for the administrative revocation of the partnership’s statement of qualification. But
       in the event a partnership disagrees with a determination by the filing office to deny the
       partnership’s application for reinstatement, this section gives the partnership a limited right to
       seek judicial review of the denial of reinstatement.

       This section does not provide for the renewal of a name reservation for successive 120-day periods. A new reservation may be filed upon the expiration of a reservation, but by
       requiring a new filing this section creates the possibility that another party may timely submit a

       the procedure in this section cannot be used to block a name indefinitely.

       A change in the identity of the registered agent of an LLP or registered foreign LLP or a
       change of the office address of a partnership’s registered agent are usually routine matters that do
       not affect the rights of the partners of the represented LLP. This section permits those changes to
       be made without: (i) amendment of an LLP’s statement of qualification or a registered foreign
       LLPs registration; and (ii) any approval by an LLP’s partners. For the registered agent’s power to
       resign, see Section 910. For the registered agent’s power to change its name, address, or both,
       see
       Section 911.

       Resignation under this section may be accomplished solely by action of the registered

       procedures for a bulk filing with one filing listing the names of all the registered agent’s

       registered foreign LLP must respond to the process, notice, or demand served. Under Subsection
       (b)(1), service is effected on the date of receipt by the partnership of the mail or commercial
       delivery. Under Subsection (b)(2), service is effected on the date shown on the return receipt, if
       signed on behalf of the partnership. Under Subsection (b)(3), service is effected five days after it
       is deposited with the Postal Service or with a similar commercial delivery service, if correctly
       addressed and with correct postage or payment. Service is effective at the earliest of the three
       listed circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, for the party effecting service there are difficulties of proof under the first two
       circumstances. Under Subsection (b)(1) the exact date of the receipt by the LLP or registered
       foreign LLP of mail or commercial delivery is peculiarly within the knowledge of the
       partnership. Under Subsection (b)(2) the return receipt must be signed on behalf of the
       partnership. That requirement is designed to assure that the service is actually received by the
       partnership, but the signature on the return receipt may not always show unambiguously that the
       signer was acting for the partnership and was authorized to do so. As a practical matter,
       therefore, parties effecting service under Subsection (b) may find it most convenient to rely on
       Subsection (b)(3) and to maintain their own records so that the date of deposit in the mails or
       with a commercial delivery service can easily be established.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides a means for serving process on an LLP or
       registered foreign LLP that cannot be served under Subsection (a) or (b). In such circumstances,
       some statutes require or permit service of process to be made on the filing office.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —For an example, see,
       e.g.
    ,
       Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h)(1)(B) (authorizing service
       on “a domestic or foreign corporation, or a partnership or other unincorporated association that is
       subject to suit under a common name” to be made on “an officer, a managing or general agent, or
       any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process”).

       In some states, an annual or biennial report by a limited liability partnership or a

       —The requirement that the report include the name of at least one
       partner will be a new requirement in some states. There has been increasing pressure from law
       enforcement agencies for access to more information about the ownership and control of legal

       about the affairs of the limited liability partnership. Members of the public will also have that

       For the purposes of this section, “jurisdiction of formation” refers to the jurisdiction
       under whose law a foreign partnership became a limited liability partnership. Strictly speaking,
       becoming an LLP involves transforming an already existing entity, not forming a new one.
       Cf.
    Section 201(b) (making this point as to domestic LLPs).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides that the laws of the jurisdiction of formation of
       a foreign LLP, rather than the laws of this state, govern both the internal affairs of the foreign
       LLP and the liability of its partners for the obligations of the LLP. A partnership agreement
       cannot change this provision. Section 105(c)(17).
      </p>
      <p>
       This subdivision parallels Section 104(1) (pertaining to the governing law for domestic
       LLPs).

        Subsections (b) and (c)

       —These sections together make clear that, although a foreign
       LLP may not be denied registration simply because of a difference between the laws of its
       jurisdiction of formation and the laws of this state, the foreign limited liability partnership “may
       not engage in any activity or exercise any power a domestic LLP may not engage in or exercise in this state.” Subsection (c).

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —Following a long-established tradition, this act does not state what
       constitutes “do[ing] business in this state.” Instead, Section 1005 provides a non-exhaustive list
       of “[a]ctivities of a foreign limited liability partnership which do not constitute doing business in
       this state.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —The purpose of this subsection is to induce foreign limited liability
       partnerships to register without imposing harsh or erratic sanctions. Often the failure to register
       is a result of inadvertence or bona fide disagreement as to the scope of Section 1005, which is
       necessarily imprecise. Thus, the imposition of harsh sanctions in those situations is
       inappropriate. The sanction of closing the courts of the state to suits brought by foreign LLPs
       that should have registered is not a punitive one. If a foreign LLP should have registered and
       failed to do so, it may still enforce its contractual and other rights simply by registering.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if a court dismisses a case under this subsection rather than staying the
       proceedings pending the foreign LLP’s registration, a statute of limitations problem may occur.
       Corco, Inc. v. Ledar Transport, Inc.
    946 P.2d 1009, 1010 (Kan. Ct. App. 1997) (“[T]he proper
       remedy was to dismiss [the unregistered entity's] counterclaim without prejudice rather than with
       prejudice. This would leave [the entity] the opportunity to comply with the statutes and then
       reassert its claim against [the defendant]. On the other hand, it would also leave the risk that the
       statute of limitations might run against [the entity].”).
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection does not prevent a foreign LLP that has failed to register from
       “defending” an action or proceeding. The distinction between “maintaining” an action or
       proceeding under this subsection and “defending” an action or proceeding under Subsection (c)
       is determined on the basis of whether affirmative relief is sought. A nonregistered foreign LLP
       may interpose any defense or permissive or mandatory counterclaim to defeat a claimed
       recovery, but may not obtain an affirmative judgment based on the counterclaim without first
       registering.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —In addition to permitting a non-registered foreign LLP doing business in
       this state to defend (but not maintain) an action or proceeding, this section makes clear that
       failure to register does not impair the validity of a foreign LLP’s acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)

       shield applicable under the LLP’s governing law.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This act does not attempt to formulate an inclusive definition of what constitutes doing
       business in a state. Rather, the concept is defined in a negative fashion by Subsections (a) and
       (b), which state that certain activities do not constitute doing business.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general terms, any conduct more regular, systematic, or extensive than that described
       in Subsection (a) constitutes doing business and requires the foreign limited liability partnership
       to register to do business. Typical conduct requiring registration includes maintaining an office to
       conduct local intrastate business, selling personal property not in interstate commerce, entering
       into contracts relating to the local business or sales, and owning or using real estate for general
       purposes. But the passive owning of real estate for investment purposes does not constitute doing
       business.
       See
    Subsection (a)(10).
      </p>
      <p>
       The test of “doing business” defined in a negative way in Subsections (a) and (b) applies
       only to the question whether a foreign limited liability partnership ’s contacts with the state are
       such that it must register under this section. The test is not applicable to other questions such as
       whether the foreign LLP is amenable to service of process under state “long-arm” statutes or
       liable for state or local taxes. A foreign LLP that has registered (or is required to register) will
       generally be subject to suit and state taxation in the state, while a foreign LLP that is subject to
       service of process or state taxation in a state will not necessarily be required to register.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —The list of activities set forth in this subsection is not exhaustive.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(1)
       </b>
       —A foreign limited liability partnership is not “doing business” solely
       because it resorts to the courts of the state to recover an indebtedness, enforce an obligation,
       recover possession of personal property, obtain the appointment of a receiver, intervene in a
       pending proceeding, bring a petition to compel arbitration, file an appeal bond, or pursue
       appellate remedies. Similarly, a foreign LLP is not required to register merely because it files a
       complaint with a governmental agency or participates in an administrative proceeding within the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —A foreign limited liability partnership does not “do business” within
       a state under this section merely because some of its internal affairs occur within a state. Thus, a
       foreign LLP may hold meetings of its partners within a state without first registering. A foreign
       LLP also may maintain offices or agencies within a state relating solely to the transfer, exchange
       or registration of its interests without registering. Other activities relating to the internal affairs of
       the foreign LLP that do not constitute doing business under this section include having officers
       or representatives who reside within or are physically present in the state; while there, the
       officers or representatives may make executive decisions relating to the internal affairs of the
       foreign LLP without imposing on the foreign LLP the requirement that it register, if these
       activities are not so regular and systematic as to cause the residence to be viewed as a business
       office.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(5)
       </b>
       —Under this paragraph, a foreign limited liability partnership need not
       register if it sells goods in the state through independent contractors. These transactions are
       viewed as transactions by the independent contractors, not by the foreign LLP itself even though
       the foreign LLP sets some limits or ground rules for its contractors. If these controls are
       sufficiently pervasive, however, the foreign LLP may be deemed to be selling for itself in
       intrastate commerce, and not through the independent contractors and therefore engaged in doing
       business in the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(7) and (8)
       </b>
       —The mere act of making a loan by a foreign limited liability
       partnership that is not in the business of making loans does not constitute doing business in the
       state in which the loan is made. On the same theory, a foreign LLP may obtain security for the
       repayment of a loan, and foreclose or enforce the lien or security interest to collect the loan,
       without being deemed to be doing business. Similarly, a refunding or “roll over” of a loan or its
       adjustment or compromise does not involve doing business.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(9)
       </b>
       —The concept of “doing business” involves regular, repeated, and
       continuing business contacts of a local nature. A single agreement or isolated transaction within a
       state does not constitute doing business if there is no intention to repeat the transaction or engage
       in similar transactions. This act does not impose the limitation found in some statutes, such as
       Section 15.01(b)(10) of the Model Business Corporation Act, that the isolated transaction be
       completed within thirty days. A foreign LLP should not be required to register simply because it
       engages in an isolated transaction that takes longer than thirty days to complete.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(11)
       </b>
       —A foreign limited liability partnership is not “doing business” within
       the meaning of this section if it is transacting business in interstate commerce.
       See
    Subsection
       (a)(6) (stating that soliciting or obtaining orders that must be accepted outside the state before
       they become contracts is not “doing business” within the meaning of this section).
      </p>
      <p>
       These exclusions reflect the provisions of the United States Constitution that grant to the
       United States Congress exclusive power over interstate commerce, and preclude states from
       imposing restrictions or conditions upon this commerce. This subsection should be construed in a
       manner consistent with judicial decisions under the United States Constitution. Under these decisions, a foreign entity is not required to register even though it sells goods within the state if
       they are shipped to the purchasers in interstate commerce. Thus a foreign LLP need not register
       even if it also does work and performs acts within the state incidental to the interstate business
       (
    e.g.
    , if it takes or enforces a security interest incidental to these transactions). Nor is it required
       to register merely because it sends traveling salespeople or solicitors into a state so long as
       contracts are not made within the state. Similarly, an office may be maintained by a foreign LLP
       in this state without registering if the office’s functions relate solely to interstate commerce.
       Purchases of goods may of course be in interstate commerce as readily as sales. Thus, the
       purchase of personal property in this state by a foreign limited liability partnership for shipment
       in interstate commerce out of the state does not require the entity to register.

       When a registered foreign limited liability partnership has converted to a domestic “filing

        Introductory Comment
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This article deals comprehensively with both same-type and cross-type mergers and interest exchanges and with conversions and domestications. For this article to apply, at least one participant organization must be a domestic general partnership (regardless of whether the partnership is an LLP). For a foreign organization to be involved, its organic law must permit the organization’s participation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part 1 contains definitions specific to this article as well as provisions applicable to all transactions authorized by this article.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part 2 governs mergers and is an amalgamation of existing entity law, both unincorporated and incorporated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part 3 governs interest exchanges, previously a feature only of corporate law. Part 3 is derived from the share exchange provisions in Chapter 11 of the Model Business Corporation Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part 4 governs conversions, a one-step procedure by which an entity changes from one type of entity to another type while nonetheless continuing in existence as the same legal entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part 5 governs domestications, a procedure by a domestic limited liability partnership can become a foreign limited liability partnership or vice versa, in each instance with the partnership remaining the same legal entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part 2 sets the paradigm for Parts 3, 4, and 5, because mergers are long established, and merger rules and concepts are familiar to business lawyers. Moreover, conversions and domestications could formerly be accomplished via mergers (with a new entity), and an interest exchange produces the same result as a triangular merger. The comments to Part 2 are thus relevant to understanding Parts 3, 4, and 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       This article contemplates transactions in which the surviving entity is neither a filing entity nor otherwise of record in the filing office (
    e.g
    ., the merger of an LLC into a non-LLP general partnership). As a result, a filing under this article may be the first time that a filing office takes cognizance of an entity’s existence.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section defines the terms that are used in this article. Many of the definitions
       describe attributes that are significant in some forms of entity and not in others. For example, the
       concept of separate “distributional” and “governance” interests are inherent in unincorporated
       entities but have no counterpart in corporations. In addition, because some statutes use different
       terms to describe the same transaction, the definitions are intended to be broad enough to
       encompass those similar transactions, regardless of how described.
       See, e.g.
    , the comment to
       Paragraph 8.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Acquired entity” [(1)]
       </b>
       —This definition recognizes that an interest exchange may
       involve only the acquisition of a particular “class” or “series” of interests in an entity. Model
       Business Corporation Act section 6.01 does not expressly define “classes” or “series.” Because
       the interests of members in an unincorporated business organization often tend to be distinctive,
       it may be that each member’s interest will comprise a separate class or series. For an explanation
       of a new and different meaning of the word “series,” see Section 1131, comment. The term
       “acquired entity” does not encompass series under that new meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Acquiring entity” [(2)]
       </b>
       —An “acquiring entity” is an entity that acquires the interests of
       the acquired entity in an interest exchange governed by Part 3 of this article.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Conversion” [(3)]
       </b>
       —The term “conversion” means a transaction authorized by Part 4
       pursuant to which an entity of one type is converted into an entity of another type. As used in this
       act, the term “conversion” does not include a transaction in which an entity changes the
       jurisdiction in which it is organized but does not change to a different form of entity; that type of
       transaction is referred to in this act as a “domestication” and is governed by Article 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Converted entity” [(4)]
       </b>
       —This term is used in Part 4 to refer to the entity that results
       from a conversion.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Converting entity” [(5)]
       </b>
       —A converting entity is the entity that becomes the converted
       entity under Part 4.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Distributional interest” [(6)]
       </b>
       —This term is similar to the concept of a “transferable
       interest” found in this act and the organic laws of several other types of unincorporated entities,
       but has a broader meaning because the scope of this act includes entities in addition to those
       whose organic law uses the term “transferable interest.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Domestic” [(7)]
       </b>
       —The term “domestic”, when used in this article with respect to an
       entity, refers to an entity whose internal affairs are governed by the organic laws of this state. In
       the case of a general partnership organized under UPA (1997) (Last Amended 2013), the term
       will mean a general partnership whose governing law under UPA (1997) § 104 is the law of the
       adopting state. Under that section, the governing law is determined by the location of the
       partnership’s principal office, except for limited liability partnerships whose governing law is the
       law of the state where the LLP’s statement of qualification is filed.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Domesticated limited liability partnership” [(8)]
       </b>
       —This term is used in Part 5 and
       means the entity limited liability partnership that is domesticated pursuant to Part 5. By the
       nature of the transaction, the domesticated entity will be of the same type as the domesticating
       entity –
       i.e.
    , a limited liability partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Domesticating limited liability partnership” [(9)]
       </b>
       —This term is used in Part 5 and
       means the entity that is domesticated pursuant to Part 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sections 1101(8) and (9) and 1151(a) exclude non-LLP general partnerships from
       domestications. However, a non-LLP general partnership that seeks to change its governing law
       may obtain that result through other means.
       See
    the comment to Section1151(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Domestication” [(10)]
       </b>
       —The term “domestication” means a transaction of the kind
       authorized by Part 5 pursuant to which an entity may change its
       jurisdiction
    of formation
       <i>
        but not
        its type
       </i>
       so long as the laws of the foreign jurisdiction permit the domestication. The legal effect
       of the domestication of an LLP out of this state will be governed by the laws of both this state
       and the foreign jurisdiction. Some statutes include what is described in this act as
       “domestication” in their definition of a “conversion.”
       <i>
        See, e.g.
       </i>
       ,
       Colo. Rev. Stat. § 7-90-201. It
       is intended that the domestication provisions of this act will apply to a transaction that may be
       characterized under another act as a “conversion” if the transaction meets the definition of
       “domestication” under this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Entity” [(11)]
       </b>
       —This definition determines the overall scope of the act because only an
       “entity” may participate in the transactions authorized by Parts 2 (mergers), 3 (interest
       exchanges), 4 (conversions), and 5 (domestications).
       See
    Sections 1121 (authorization of
       mergers), 1131 (authorization of interest exchanges), 1141 (authorization of conversions), 1151 (authorization of domestications).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subparagraph (A)(x) is a “catch-all” provision that includes within the definition of
       “entity” any type of organization recognized under the law of this state which is not listed
       specifically in the preceding paragraphs of this definition. Subparagraph (A)(x) is intended to
       include all forms of private organizations, regardless of whether organized for profit, and
       artificial legal persons other than those excluded by Subparagraph (B). This definition does not
       exclude regulated entities such as public utilities, banks, and insurance companies. Should a state
       desire to exclude certain types of regulated entities or any of the entities listed in Subparagraph
       (A)(i)–(x) from participating in transactions permitted by this act for policy reasons, that may be
       done by listing those types of entities in Section 1107(a), or by permitting those type of entities
       to engage in transactions under this act generally but prohibiting certain types of transactions by
       listing those transactions in Section 1107(b).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unincorporated nonprofit associations are treated as a type of entity in Subparagraph
       (A)(viii) because Section 5 of the Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act (2008)
       (Last Amended 2013) specifically states that an unincorporated nonprofit association is an entity.
       In many states, the status of a nonprofit association may not be clear. Nevertheless, in most states
       a nonprofit association has the power to acquire an interest in real property in its own name and
       therefore would qualify as an “entity” under Subparagraph (A)(x).
       See
    UUNAA § 6 (giving an
       unincorporated nonprofit association the power to acquire in its own name an interest in real
       property).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subparagraph (B)(i) of this definition excludes a sole proprietorship from the concept of
       an “entity.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Trusts with a predominately donative purpose, such as inter vivos and testamentary trusts
       and charitable trusts, are treated in many states as having a separate legal existence, but they
       have been excluded from the definition of “entity” (and thus are not within the scope of this
       article) under Subparagraph (B)(ii) because they should not be able to engage in transactions
       under this act as a matter of public policy. Trusts that carry on a business, however, such as
       business and statutory entity trusts, are “entities.”
       See
    Subparagraph (A)(ix).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subparagraph (B)(iii) of this definition excludes from the concept of an “entity” any form
       of co-ownership of property or sharing of returns from property that is not listed in Subparagraph
       (A) and is not a partnership under this act. In that connection, Section 202(c) of this act provides
       in part:
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether a partnership is formed, the following rules apply:
      </p>
      <ol type="1">
       <li id="t07c12.1p01s7-12.1-1101-officialcommentol11">
        Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property,  common property, or part ownership does not by itself establish a partnership, even  if the co-owners share profits made by the use of the property.
       </li>
       <li id="t07c12.1p01s7-12.1-1101-officialcommentol12">
        The sharing of gross returns does not by itself establish a partnership, even  if the persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in property  from which the returns are derived.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Limited liability partnerships and limited liability limited partnerships are “entities” because they are general partnerships and limited partnerships respectively that have taken the
       necessary steps to obtain LLP or LLLP status. A limited liability partnership is not, therefore, a
       separate type of entity from the underlying general or limited partnership that has elected limited
       liability partnership status. Thus, for example, the election of a general partnership to become a
       limited liability partnership is not a conversion subject to Article 4.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Subparagraph (B)(iv), decedent’s estates are excluded from the definition of an
       entity for the same policy reason as trusts with a predominately donative purpose and charitable
       trusts.
      </p>
      <p>
       This same public policy rationale is the justification for the exclusion of governmental
       subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities in Subparagraph (B)(v).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Filing entity” [Paragraph (12)]
       </b>
       —Whether an entity is a filing entity is determined by
       reference to whether its legal existence requires the filing of a document with the state filing
       officer. To fit within this definition, the filing must be necessary but need not be sufficient to
       form the entity.
       See, e.g.
    , ULLCA (2006) (Last Amended 2013) § 201(d) (“A limited liability
       company is formed when the company’s certificate of organization becomes effective
       <i>
        and
       </i>
       at
       least one person becomes a member.”) (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the statute refers to the “formation” of an entity, the term is intended to encompass
       corporations that are “incorporated,” as well as other filing entities whose statutes refer to them
       as being “organized.” Business trusts present a special problem. In some states a business trust
       could be a filing entity or a common law relationship, while in other states business trusts are
       only recognized at common law. A statutory trust entity formed under the Uniform Statutory
       Trust Entity Act (2009) (Last Amended 2013) § 201(a) is a filing entity, because a statutory trust
       entity is formed by the filing office filing a certificate of trust pertaining to the entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “filing entity” does not include a limited liability partnership because, while a
       filed document is precondition to LLP status, that document (a statement of qualification under
       Section 901) does not form the underlying entity. A limited liability limited partnership, on the
       other hand, is a filing entity because the underlying limited partnership is formed by filing a
       certificate of limited partnership. ULPA (2001) (Last Amended 2013) § 201(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Foreign” [(13)]
       </b>
       —The term “foreign entity” includes any non-domestic entity of any
       type. Where a foreign entity is a filing entity, the entity is governed by the laws of the state of
       filing. A nonfiling foreign entity is governed by the laws governing its internal affairs. It is a
       factual question whether a general partnership whose internal affairs are governed by UPA (1914) is a domestic or foreign partnership. A UPA (1914) partnership will likely be deemed to
       be a domestic entity where the greatest nexus of contacts are found. The domestic or foreign
       characterization of partnerships under this act that are not limited liability partnerships will be
       governed by Section 104(2) (“the law of the jurisdiction in which the partnership has its principal
       office”) or the partnership agreement. (Section 104(2) is a default rule.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Governance interest” [(14)]
       </b>
       —A governance interest is typically only part of the
       interest that a person will hold in an unincorporated entity and is usually coupled with a distributional interest (or economic rights). Memberships in some nonprofit corporations and
       unincorporated nonprofit associations consist solely of governance interests and memberships in
       other nonprofit entities may not include either governance interests or distributional interests. In
       some unincorporated business entities, including partnerships, there is a more limited right to
       transfer governance interests than there is to transfer distributional interests. An interest holder in
       such an unincorporated business entity who transfers only a distributional interest and retains the
       governance interest will also retain the status of an interest holder. Whether a transferee who
       acquires only a distributional interest will acquire the status of an interest holder is determined
       by the definition of “interest holder.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Governors of an entity have the kinds of rights listed in the definition of “governance
       interest” by reason of their position with the entity. For a governor to have a “governance
       interest,” however, requires that the governor also have those rights for a reason other than the
       governor’s status as such. A manager who is not a member in a limited liability company, for
       example, will not have a governance interest, but a manager who is a member will have a
       governance interest arising from the ownership of a membership interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Governor” [(15)]
       </b>
       —This term has been chosen to provide a way of referring to a person
       who has the authority under an entity’s organic law to make management decisions regarding the
       entity that is different from any of the existing terms used in connection with particular types of
       entities. Depending on the type of entity or its organic rules, the governors of an entity may have
       the power to act on their own authority, or they may be organized as a board or similar group and
       have only the power to act collectively, and then only through a designated agent. In other words,
       a person having only the power to bind the organization pursuant to the instruction of the
       governors is not a governor. Under the organic rules, particularly those of unincorporated
       entities, most or all of the management decisions may be reserved to the members or partners.
       Thus, if a manager of a limited liability company were limited to having authority to execute
       management decisions made by the members and did not have any authority to make
       independent management decisions, the manager would not be a governor under this definition.

        “Interest” [(16)]
       </b>
       —In the usual case, the interest held by an interest holder will include both a governance interest and a distributional interest. Members in nonprofit corporations or
       unincorporated nonprofit associations generally do not have any distributional interest because
       they do not receive distributions, but they nonetheless may hold a governance interest in which
       case they would have the status of interest holders under this article.

        “Interest exchange” [(17)]
       </b>
       —The term “interest exchange” means a transaction
       authorized by Part 3 pursuant to which an entity may acquire interests in another entity. The
       consideration that may be provided to the interest holders whose interests are being acquired in
       an exchange may consist in whole or part of interests in a third party that is not one of the two
       parties to the exchange itself.

        “Interest holder” [(18)]
       </b>
       —This article does not refer to “equity” interests or “equity”
       owners or holders because the term “equity” could be confusing in the case of a nonprofit entity
       whose members do not have an interest in the assets or results of operations of the entity but
       have only a right to vote on its internal affairs.

       <b>
        “Interest holder liability” [(19)]
       </b>
       —This term is used to describe the vicarious liability of
       an interest holder, by virtue of being an interest holder, for liabilities of the entity. The term
       includes only personal liability of an interest holder for a debt of the entity imposed on the
       interest holder either by statute or by the organic rules to the extent authorized pursuant to the
       organic law. Liabilities that an interest holder incurs in any other fashion are not interest holder
       liabilities for purposes of this act. Thus, for example, if a state’s business corporation law makes
       shareholders personally liable for unpaid wages because of their status as shareholders, that
       liability would be an “interest holder liability.” If, on the other hand, a shareholder were to
       guarantee payment of an obligation of a corporation, that liability would not be an “interest
       holder liability” because it is a direct liability and not based on the status of being a shareholder.
       Similarly, the liability to return an improper distribution is not an interest holder liability because
       it is a direct liability of the interest holder based on receipt of the distribution.

       combined into a single entity pursuant to a filing by the filing office. The term “merger” in this
       act includes the transaction known as a consolidation in which a new entity results from the
       combination of two or more pre-existing entities.

       <b>
        “Merging entity” [(21)]

       existence immediately before a merger and is a party to the merger. It will include the surviving
       entity if the surviving entity exists before the merger becomes effective. It does not include an
       entity that provides consideration to be received by interest holders if that entity is not a party to
       the merger.

       <b>
        “Organic law” [(22)]
       </b>
       —Organic law means statutes that govern the internal affairs of an
       entity. For example, this act is the organic law of a limited liability partnership whose statement
       of qualification is filed under this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Entity laws in a few states purport to require that some of their internal governance rules
       applicable to a domestic entity also apply to a foreign entity with significant ties to the state.
       See,
       e.g.
    ,
       Cal. Corp. Code § 2115 (Foreign Corporations);
       N.Y. Not-for-Profit-Corp. §§ 1318– 21
       (Liabilities of Directors and Officers of Foreign Corporations);
       15
       Pa.Cons. Stat. § 6145
       (Applicability of Certain Safeguards to Foreign Corporations). Such a “sticky fingers” law is not
       included within the definition of “organic law” for purposes of this act because those laws are
       not part of the law of the entity’s jurisdiction of formation.

      <p>
       <b>
        “Organic rules” [(23)]
       </b>
       —The term “organic rules” means an entity’s public organic
       record and the private organic rules. The organic rules, together with this act, the organic law,
       and the common law, provide the rules governing the internal affairs of the entity. For example,
       this act and the partnership agreement comprise the organic rules of a limited liability partnership
       formed under this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Plan” [(24)]
       </b>
       —The term “plan” is a short-hand way of referring to the plan of merger,
       interest exchange, conversion, or domestication, as the case may be, depending on which form of
       transaction is taking place.
       See
    Sections 1122 (plan of merger), 1132 (plan of interest exchange),
       1142 (plan of conversion), 1152 (plan of domestication).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Private organic rules” [(29)]
       </b>
       —The term private “organic rules” is intended to include
       all governing rules of an entity that are binding on all of its interest holders, whether or not in
       record form, except for the provisions of the entity’s public organic record, if any. The term is
       intended to include agreements in “record” form such as corporate bylaws, as well as oral
       partnership agreements and oral operating agreements among LLC members.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Protected agreement” [(30)]
       </b>
       —The term “protected agreement” refers to evidences of
       indebtedness and agreements binding on the entity or any of its governors or interest holders that
       are unpaid or executory in whole or in part on the effective date of the act. Thus a revolving line
       of credit from a bank to a corporation would constitute a protected agreement even if advances
       were not made until after the effective date of the act. Likewise, a partnership agreement in effect
       under this act or a predecessor to this act is a “protected agreement.”
      </p>
      <p>
       If a protected agreement has provisions that apply if an entity merges, those provisions
       will apply if the entity enters into an interest exchange, conversion, or domestication even though
       the agreement does not mention those other types of transactions.
       See
    Sections 1131(c) (interest
       exchange), 1141(c) (conversion), 1151(c) (domestication).

      <p>
       <b>
        “Public organic record” [(31)]
       </b>
       —A “public organic record” is a record that is filed
       publicly to form, organize, incorporate, or otherwise create an entity. The term does not include a
       statement of authority under this act or any of the other statements that may be filed under this
       act since those statements do not create a new entity. Thus, a statement of qualification filed
       under Section 1003 is not a “public organic record.” The limited liability partnership that results
       from the filing is the same entity as the partnership that delivered the statement to the filing
       office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, the term does not include a statement of authority filed under Section 7 of the
       Revised Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act (2008) (Last Amended 2013), a
       statement appointing a registered agent filed under Section 31 of that act, or any of the various statements filed under the ULLCA (2006) (Last Amended 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       In those states where a deed of trust or other instrument is publicly filed to create a
       business trust, that filing will constitute a public organic record. But in those states where a
       business trust is not created by a public filing, the deed of trust or similar record will be part of
       the private organic rules of the business trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a public organic document has been amended or restated, the term means the
       public organic document as last amended or restated.

        “Surviving entity” [(37)]

      <p>
       <b>
        “Type of entity” [(38]
       </b>
       —The term “type of entity” has been developed in an attempt to
       distinguish different legal forms of entities. It is sometimes difficult to decide whether one is
       222 dealing with a different form of entity or a variation of the same form. For example, a limited
       partnership, although it has long been characterized or even defined as a partnership, is a
       different type of entity from a general partnership, while a limited liability partnership is not a
       different type of entity from a general partnership. In some states cooperatives are categories of
       business corporations or nonprofit corporations, while in other states cooperatives are a separate
       type of entity.

      <p>
       This section preserves existing regulatory law in an adopting state in general terms.
       Adopting states should consider more carefully integrating this act with their various regulatory
       laws. For example, in some states certain professions are limited in their use of limited liability
       entities.
       See
    Section 1103.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws other than this act that will apply to transactions under the act include, for example,
       uniform fraudulent transfer and fraudulent conveyance acts, state insolvency statutes, federal
       bankruptcy law, and Articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —Many states have enacted “antitakeover” statutes intended to make it
       more difficult to acquire control of a publicly traded corporation. Those statutes often provide
       that their application to a particular corporation cannot be changed unless the corporation obtains
       certain specified approvals, such as a vote of disinterested directors or a supermajority vote by the shareholders. The purpose of the special requirements in this subsection on varying the
       application of an antitakeover statute is to protect against a hostile acquirer or group of
       shareholders seeking to use the act to avoid the application of the antitakeover statute.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection protects the application of antitakeover statutes from being affected by a
       transaction under this act by requiring that the transaction be approved in a manner that would be
       sufficient to approve changing the application of the antitakeover statute. If a transaction is
       approved in that manner, there is no policy reason to prohibit the application of the antitakeover
       statute from being varied by a transaction under this act. If the application of an antitakeover
       statute cannot be varied by action of an entity subject to it, then a transaction under this act will
       be permissible only if the antitakeover provision continues to apply after the transaction or the
       transaction itself is permissible under the antitakeover statute.

        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —Because at least some of the provisions of this act will be new in most
       states, it is likely that existing state laws that require regulatory approval of transactions by
       businesses such as banks, insurance companies, or public utilities may not be worded in a
       fashion that will include at least some of the transactions authorized by this act. The purpose of
       this subsection is to ensure that transactions under this act will be subject to the same regulatory
       approval as mergers. This subsection is based on whether a merger by a regulated entity requires
       prior approval because the transactions authorized by this act may be effectuated indirectly in
       many cases under existing law by establishing a wholly owned subsidiary of the desired type and
       then merging into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The consequence of violating this subsection should be the same as in the case of a
       merger consummated without the required approval.

        Subsection (b)

       nonprofit associations. As in the case of laws regulating particular industries, a state’s laws
       governing the nondiversion of charitable property to other uses may not cover some of the
       transactions authorized by this act. To prevent the procedures in this act from being used to avoid
       restrictions on the use of such charitable property, this subsection requires approval of the effect
       of transactions under this act by the appropriate arm of government having supervision of
       nonprofit entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       An approval or order obtained under this section may impose conditions or specify the
       disposition of assets or liabilities in a manner different than would otherwise be the case. In such

      <p>
       In corporate law, appraisal rights developed when corporate statutes were amended to
       permit mergers with less than unanimous consent of the shareholders. This article provides no
       appraisal rights, because as a default rule transactions under this article require the consent or
       affirmative vote of all the partners. Where the partnership agreement changes this default rule,
       parties may wish to consider contractual appraisal rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection validates the grant of such contractual appraisal rights.
       Cf.
    6
       Del. Code Ann. §§ 15-120 (general partnerships), 17-212 (limited partnerships), 18-210 (limited liability
       companies) (validating “contractual appraisal rights”);
       Model Bus. Corp. Act § 13.02(5)
       (permitting the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or a resolution of the board of directors to
       confer appraisal rights in contexts in which they would otherwise not be available). Legislative
       authorization in this subsection of the grant of contractual appraisal rights removes any question
       as to whether a court would have jurisdiction to hear a case in which the parties were attempting
       to create jurisdiction in the court by private agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this section, the term “appraisal rights” refers to any arrangement, either in the
       partnership agreement or the plan, providing for the buy-out of partners that object to a
       transaction under this article.

      <p>
       The merger transaction authorized by this act involves the combination of one or more
       domestic general partnerships with or into one or more other domestic or foreign entities. It also
       contemplates the consolidation of two or more foreign entities into a single domestic general
       partnership. Upon the effective date of the merger, all the assets and liabilities of the constituent
       entities vest in the surviving entity as a matter of law. As such, mergers require the existence of
       at least two separate entities before the transaction and only one entity may survive the merger. If
       independent existence of the constituent entities is desired following the conclusion of the
       transaction, a restructuring transaction other than a merger must be used to accomplish the
       transfer of assets and liabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       This act authorizes a merger for state entity law purposes. Federal law and other state law
       will independently determine how a merger transaction will be taxed.

        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection states the requirements for the plan of merger. They are
       similar to plan of merger provisions in corporation statutes.
       See
    Model Bus. Corp. Act §
       11.02(c). The requirements stated in this subsection are mandatory.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 105(c)(15).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(1)
       </b>
       —This paragraph requires that the plan of merger identify the parties to
       the merger. The name of a merging entity as it appears in the plan of merger will be its name in
       its jurisdiction of formation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(3)
       </b>
       —The language of this paragraph is similar to Model Business
       Corporation Act § 11.02(c)(3). What may be done under this paragraph with respect to providing
       for continuing interests in the surviving entity for some holders of interests of a class or series of
       a party to the merger while paying some other form of consideration to other holders of the same
       class or series of interests in that entity will vary depending on the type of entity involved and the
       extent to which its organic rules provide for non-uniform treatment of interest holders in a
       manner that is permissible under its organic law. Similarly the ability to use a merger to
       reorganize the capital structure of the surviving entity will vary depending on the type of entity
       involved and whether the entity has appropriately adopted relevant provisions in its organic
       rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the organic law and organic rules of an unincorporated entity permit a non-uniform
       “equity shuffle” to be accomplished in a merger involving the unincorporated entity, the minority
       owners of the unincorporated entity will not necessarily be entitled to the statutory appraisal
       rights currently afforded to minority stockholders in merging corporate entities. Any perceived
       unfairness in the shuffle would be addressed either: (i) under principles of fiduciary duties and
       the contractual obligations of good faith and fair dealing, assuming, of course, that such duties
       and obligations have not been contractually modified or eliminated to the extent permitted by the
       applicable organic law, or (ii) by the exercise of whatever rights the minority owners may have to
       veto the transaction or to withdraw or to dissociate and be paid the value of their interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Model Business Corporation Act generally requires that shares of the same class or
       series be treated in the same manner in a merger unless the corporation has adopted an applicable
       provision of its articles of incorporation pursuant to section 6.01(e) of that act providing for
       variations in the treatment of holders of the same class or series of shares. Thus, a determination
       of what may be done by way of an equity shuffle in the case of a corporation will require
       reference to its organic law and organic rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       The consideration paid to the interest holders of the merging parties may be supplied in
       whole or part by a person who is not a party to the merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides the statutory authority for a merging party to
       include a provision in a plan of merger that is not specifically listed in Subsection (a). One such
       possibility is contractual appraisal rights as provided in Section 1106(2).

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —In the uniform acts pertaining to unincorporated business organizations,
       unanimity is the default rule for approving a merger. The partnership agreement certainly can
       change this rule, but care should be taken in doing so. For example, a merger can revise the
       partnership agreement. Section 1122(a)(4). Thus, if a merger requires less-than-unanimous
       consent, the partnership agreement is subject to amendment by the same quantum of consent.
       “Exit rights” also require consideration. This act does not provide appraisal rights, because those rights are inapposite when unanimous consent is required.
       See
    the comment to Section 1106.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —This provision is not a default rule, Section 105(c)(14), and deals
       with the situation in which a partner of a general partnership that is a party to a merger will have
       “interest holder liability” for the liabilities of the surviving entity which are incurred after the
       merger becomes effective. This provision applies regardless of whether the partnership is an
       LLP. The issue is not whether the partners have “interest holder liability” in their current
       partnership but rather whether they will have that liability in the surviving entity. Thus, for
       example, if general partnership Alpha merges into general partnership Beta, which is not an LLP,
       the special approval requirement in Subsection (a)(2) will be applicable to each Alpha partner
       who will become a Beta partner—regardless of whether Alpha is a limited liability partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       The consent of a partner required by Subsection (a)(2)(B) may be given either by: (i)
       signing or agreeing generally to the terms of a partnership agreement that includes the required
       provision permitting less than unanimous approval of a merger in which partners become subject
       to “interest holder liability,” or (ii) voting for or consenting to an amendment to the partnership agreement to add such a provision.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —Where a domestic entity other than a general partnership is a party to a
       merger under this act, this subsection defers to that entity’s organic law for the requirements for
       approval of the merger by that entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —Where a foreign entity is a party to a merger under this act, this
       subsection defers to the laws of the foreign jurisdiction for the requirements for approval of the
       merger by the foreign entity. Those laws will include the organic law of the foreign entity and

      <p>
       The filing of a statement of merger makes the transaction a matter of public record.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection pertains to all merging entities involved in a merger, not
       merely any merging domestic general partnership. Other filings may be required by the organic
       law of other entities participating in the merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1) and (2)
       </b>
       —The names of foreign entities set forth in the statement of
       merger will generally be their names in their jurisdiction of formation, except that if a foreign
       entity has been required to adopt a different name in order to register to do business in this state,
       the foreign qualification statute will likely require that, when the entity does business in this
       state, the entity must use the name adopted for the purposes of registering to do business.
       Engaging in a merger under this act will be part of the business done by the entity in this state
       and the name of the entity set forth in the statement of merger will thus need to be the name
       under which the entity has registered to do business. Use of the name under which the entity has
       registered to do business will allow the records in the filing office to associate the registration of
       the entity to do business with the statement of merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(3)
       </b>
       —For more information on the statement of merger, see Subsection (f),
       comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(4)
       </b>
       —The statement in this paragraph that the plan of merger was approved
       by each entity in accordance with this article necessarily presupposes that the plan was approved
       in accordance with any valid, special requirements in the organic rules of each merging entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(5) and (6)
       </b>
       —The public organic record of a domestic surviving entity
       created by the merger that is attached to the statement of merger becomes the original, officially
       filed text of the public organic record of the surviving entity when the statement of merger takes
       effect. It is not necessary, or appropriate, to make any other filing to create the surviving entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, a statement of qualification for a domestic limited liability partnership created
       by the merger that is attached to the statement of merger does not need to be filed separately.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —Organic laws typically require that an initial filing that creates an entity
       be signed by the person serving as the incorporator or other organizer. This subsection, however,
       provides that the public organic record of the surviving entity does not need to be signed since
       the record is attached to a signed record.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection also permits the public organic record of the surviving entity to omit any
       provision that is not required to be included in a restatement of the public organic record.
       Pursuant to this provision, for example, the public organic record of a business corporation
       created as the surviving entity in the merger would not need to state the name and address of
       each incorporator even though that information would be required by section 2.02(a)(4) of the
       Model Business Corporation Act if the corporation were being incorporated outside the context
       of the merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —A plan of merger that contains all the information required in the
       statement of merger may be filed instead of the statement of merger. The plan must be in a record
       and signed by each merging party.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f)
       </b>
       —A merger in which the surviving entity is a domestic general partnership
       takes effect when the statement of merger takes effect. A merger in which the surviving entity is
       a foreign entity will usually also take effect when the statement of merger takes effect because
       the practice is to coordinate the filings that need to be made when a merger involves both a
       domestic entity and also a foreign entity so that the filings in each jurisdiction take effect at the
       same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, when the surviving general partnership is a foreign general partnership, it is
       possible that the filing in the foreign jurisdiction will take effect at a different time. For that
       reason, this subsection provides that the merger will take effect at the later of: (i) when the
       statement of merger takes effect; and (ii) when the merger takes effect under the law of the
       foreign jurisdiction. This rule avoids the possibility that the merger will take effect in this state
       before it takes effect in the foreign jurisdiction, which would produce the undesirable result that
       the merging domestic general partnership would cease to appear as an active entity on the
       records of this state before the records of the foreign jurisdiction reflect a completed merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is necessary for the filing office to record only the effective date of the statement of
       merger, and the filing office does not need to be concerned with the effective date of the merger
       itself. Persons wishing to determine the effective date of a merger involving both a domestic and
       a foreign entity will be able to do so by consulting the records of the filing offices in each
       jurisdiction.

      </h4>
      <p>
       With the exception of Subsections (c) and (d), this section is similar to statutory
       provisions on the effect of a merger of a corporation with a corporation.
       See
    Model Bus. Corp. Act § 11.07.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection states the general understanding that in a merger the
       assets and liabilities of the merging entities automatically vest in the surviving entity. The
       surviving entity becomes the owner of all real and personal property of the merged entities and is
       subject to all debts, obligations, and liabilities of the merging entities. A merger does not
       constitute a transfer, assignment, or conveyance of any property held by the merging entities
       before the merger. A merger also does not give rise to a claim that a contract with a merging
       entity is no longer in effect on the ground of nonassignability, unless the contract specifically
       provides that it does not survive a merger. The contract rights that are vested in the surviving
       entity include the right to enforce subscription agreements for interests and obligations to make
       capital contributions entered into or incurred before the merger.
       See
    Section 1103(c) (dealing
       with the surviving entity’s rights in trust obligations of a nonsurviving party in a merger and
       transactions such as bequests made to a nonsurviving party to a merger that take effect after the
       merger).
      </p>
      <p>
       After a merger has become effective, the law of the surviving entity’s jurisdiction of
       formation governs the surviving entity.
       See
    Sections 1103(a) and (b) (modifying the provisions
       of this section with respect to the effects of a merger to the extent a regulatory law provides
       otherwise or any of the parties holds property committed to charitable purposes).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —A merger cannot have the effect of making an interest holder of a
       domestic merging general partnership subject to interest holder liability for the debts,
       obligations, or other liabilities of any other person or entity unless the interest holder has signed
       a separate written consent to become subject to such liability or previously agreed to the
       effectuation of a transaction having that effect without the interest holder’s consent. The
       partnership agreement cannot change this provision. Section 105(c)(14).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(7)
       </b>
       —All pending proceedings involving either the survivor or a party
       whose separate existence ceased as a result of the merger are continued. Under this paragraph,
       the name of the survivor may be, but need not be, substituted in any pending proceeding for the
       name of a party to the merger whose separate existence ceased as a result of the merger. The
       substitution may be made whether the survivor is a complainant or a respondent, and may be
       made at the instance of either the survivor or an opposing party. That substitution has no
       substantive effect because, whether or not the survivor’s name is substituted, the survivor
       succeeds to the claims, and is subject to the liabilities, of any party to the merger whose separate
       existence ceased as a result of the merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(8)(B)
       </b>
       —The private organic rules of an unincorporated entity typically
       may be either oral or written. The plan of merger is not required to set forth amendments to oral
       provisions of the private organic rules of the surviving entity, and thus this provision is limited in
       scope to amendments to the private organic rules that are to be in a record, if any.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(10)
       </b>
       —For more information on appraisal rights, see Section 1106, comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsections (c) and (d)
       </b>
       —These subsections set forth rules for two circumstances that
       typically do not exist in a merger where all the entities involved are corporations. Subsection (c)
       deals with the situation where an interest holder that does not have vicarious liability for the
       obligations of a merging entity before the merger has interest holder liability after the merger. An
       example would be a corporate shareholder who agrees to be the general partner in a limited
       partnership that is the surviving entity in a merger between a corporation and a limited
       partnership that is not a limited liability limited partnership. Subsection (d) deals with the
       situation where an interest holder has vicarious liability for the obligations of one of the merging
       parties before the merger but ceases to have any interest holder liability for the obligations of the
       surviving entity after the merger becomes effective. An example would be a general partner in a
       general partnership that merges into a corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effects of Subsections (c) and (d) will depend on when a liability is incurred, which
       is determined by other law. For a discussion of the issue, see the comment to Section 404(c) (The
       Temporal Nexus – When Claim Incurred).
      </p>
      <p>
       These subsections apply not only to merging domestic general partnerships but also to
       any other domestic entity involved in the merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This subsection sets forth the general rule that an interest holder that
       was not liable for the liabilities of a merging entity before the merger but will have personal
       liability for the obligations of the surviving entity after the merger will be personally liable only
       for the liabilities of a domestic surviving entity that are incurred after the effective date of a
       merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —This subsection uses “arose” as its term of art, while Section 306(b) and
       (c) use “incur.” The difference is historical, and no difference in meaning is intended. For a
       discussion of case law interpreting “incurred,” see Section 306(b), comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection provides four rules with respect to an interest holder who ceases to have
       interest holder liability after the effective date of the merger:
      </p>
      <ol type="1">
       <li id="t07c12.1p02s7-12.1-1126-officialcommentol11">
        the interest holder remains personally liable for any obligations that were incurred  before the effective date of the merger;
       </li>
       <li id="t07c12.1p02s7-12.1-1126-officialcommentol12">
        the interest holder does not have any personal liability for obligations of the  surviving entity;
       </li>
       <li id="t07c12.1p02s7-12.1-1126-officialcommentol13">
        the pre-existing personal liability of the interest holder is enforced against the  interest holder on the same basis as if the merger had not taken place; and
       </li>
       <li id="t07c12.1p02s7-12.1-1126-officialcommentol14">
        the interest holder has the same rights of contribution from other interest holders  of the merging entity as the interest holder would have had if the merger had not  occurred.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       See
    the comment to Section 1146(d).

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —When a merger has become effective, this subsection provides that a
       foreign entity that is the surviving entity may be served with process in this state. The
       proceedings covered by this subsection include a proceeding to enforce the rights of any interest
       holders of each domestic merging entity who are entitled to and exercise appraisal rights. One of
       the liabilities that a foreign surviving entity succeeds to is the obligation of a merging entity to
       pay the amount, if any, to which its interest holders who assert appraisal rights are entitled.

      </h4>
      <p>
       An interest exchange is the same type of transaction as the share exchange provided for
       in section 11.03 of the Model Business Corporation Act. The effect of an interest exchange is
       that: (i) the separate existence of the acquired entity is not affected; and (ii) the acquiring entity
       acquires all of the interests of one or more classes of the acquired entity. An interest exchange
       also allows an indirect acquisition through the use of consideration in the exchange that is not
       provided by the acquiring entity (
    e.g.
    , consideration from another or related entity).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither share exchanges nor interest exchanges are universally recognized in either
       corporation or unincorporated entity laws. The effect of an interest exchange can be achieved
       through a triangular merger in which the acquiring entity forms a new subsidiary and the
       acquired entity is then merged into the new subsidiary. Part 3 allows the interest exchange to be
       accomplished directly in a single step, rather than indirectly through the triangular merger route.
      </p>
      <p>
       The “series” referenced in Subsection (a) are not the series contemplated by the Uniform
       Statutory Entity Trust Act §§ 401-405 and some LLC statutes.
       See, e.g.
    ,
       Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, §
       18-215 (2012);
       805
       Ill. Comp. Stat. 180/37-40 (2012). Instead, in this context “series” refers to
       a subset of a class, which is a meaning commonly found in corporation law.
       <i>
        See, e.g.
       </i>
       ,
       Model
       Bus. Corp. Act § 6.02. Specific provisions authorizing classes and series are less common in
       unincorporated entity law but do exist.
       <i>
        See, e.g.
       </i>
       ,
       Minn. Stat. § 322B.155 (2012). In any event, a
       partnership agreement certainly has the power to create classes and series as contemplated by
       this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —For this section to apply, a domestic limited liability partnership must
       be either the acquiring or acquired entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The acquiring entity is not required to acquire all of the interests in the acquired entity.
       For example, assume that a general partnership with three classes of partnership interests enters
       into an interest exchange with an acquiring entity. The acquiring entity need acquire only all of the partnership interests of one or more classes of the partnership interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection allows a foreign entity to effectuate an interest
       exchange with a domestic general partnership if the interest exchange is authorized by the
       organic law of the foreign entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This subsection deals with rights of parties to protected agreements,
       Section 1101(30), when an interest exchange takes place. Because the concept of an interest
       exchange is relatively new, a person contracting with a domestic general partnership or loaning it
       money who drafted and negotiated special rights relating to the transaction before the enactment
       of this article should not be charged with the consequences of not having dealt with the concept
       of an interest exchange in the context of those special rights. Similarly, when the governance
       structure of an entity has been negotiated before the enactment of this act, the concept of an
       interest exchange may not have been reflected in any special governance arrangements; for
       example, special approval rights may have been provided for fundamental transactions, but those
       rights fail to include language that would make them applicable to an interest exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accordingly, this subsection provides a transitional rule that is intended to protect those special rights. If, for example, a general partnership is a party to a contract that provides that the
       partnership cannot participate in a merger without the consent of the other party to the contract,
       the requirement to obtain the consent of the other party will apply also to an interest exchange in
       which the partnership is the acquired entity. If the partnership fails to obtain the consent, the
       result will be that the other party will have the same rights it would have had if the entity were to
       participate in a merger without the required consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The transitional rule in this subsection ceases to make sense at the time the provisions of
       the agreement giving rise to the special rights are first amended after the effective date of this
       article because at that time the provision may be amended to address expressly an interest
       exchange. The transitional rule will continue to apply, however, if a provision other than the
       specific provisions giving rise to the special rights is amended.

       This section sets forth the requirements for the plan of interest exchange, which must be
       approved by the acquired entity in accordance with Section 1131. The content of the plan of
       interest exchange is similar to the content of a plan of merger.
       See
    Section 1122.

      <p>
       The plan of interest exchange may, but need not, be filed instead of the statement of
       interest exchange, Section 1135, so long as the plan contains all the information required to be in
       the statement and is delivered to the filing office for filing after the plan has been adopted and
       approved.

      <p>
       This section applies only when the
       acquired
    entity is a domestic general partnership, and
       this part states no rule for the effect of an interest exchange when the only domestic general
       partnership involved is the
       <i>
        acquiring
       </i>
       entity. For that situation, other provisions of this act must
       be consulted, because this act is the organic law of the acquiring entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —In contrast to a merger, an interest exchange does not in and of itself
       affect the separate existence of the parties, vest in the acquiring entity the assets of the acquired
       entity, or render the acquiring entity liable for the liabilities of the acquired entity. Thus,
       Subsection (a) is significantly simpler than Section 1126(a) with respect to the effects of a
       merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       When an interest exchange becomes effective: (i) the interests of the acquired domestic
       general partnership are exchanged, converted, or canceled as provided in the plan; (ii) the only
       rights of the former partners and transferees of the acquired partnership whose interests are
       affected by the interest exchange are those rights related to the exchange, conversion, or
       cancellation; (iii) the acquiring entity becomes the owner of the acquired partnership’s interests
       as provided in the plan; and (iv) the provisions of the partnership agreement of the acquired
       partnership that are to be in a record, if any, are amended to the extent provided in the plan of
       interest exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides the rule for future interest holder liability
       pertaining to domestic entities and parallels analogous provisions in Parts 2 (mergers), 4
       (conversions), and 5 (domestications).
       See
    the comment to Section 1126.

       This part of Article 11 permits an entity to change to a different type of entity. A
       transaction in which an entity changes its jurisdiction of organization but does not change its
       type is a domestication and is the subject of Part 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —For this provision to apply, this type of conversion must be
       authorized by the law of the foreign jurisdiction. If this is not the case, it may be possible to
       achieve the same result by forming an entity of the type desired in the foreign jurisdiction and
       then merging the domestic entity into the new foreign entity under Part 2 of Article 11.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection allows a foreign entity to effectuate a conversion into a
       domestic general partnership, but only if the conversion is permitted by the laws of the foreign
       entity’s jurisdiction of formation. When a foreign entity becomes a domestic general partnership
       pursuant to this part of Article 11, the effect of the conversion will be as provided in Section
       1146. The procedures by which the conversion is approved, however, will be determined by the
       laws of the foreign entity’s jurisdiction of formation. See Section 102(8) for the definition of
       “jurisdiction of formation.”

       <b>
        Subsection (f)
       </b>
       —Section 114 determines when a record delivered for filing under this act
       becomes effective. A statement of conversion may specify a delayed effective time and date,
       subject to the ninety-day limit stated in Section 114(3) and (4).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the statement of conversion has become effective under this subsection, the
       conversion transaction occurs if the converted entity is a domestic general partnership. A
       conversion in which the converted entity is a foreign entity will usually also take effect when the
       statement of conversion takes effect because the best practice will be to coordinate the filings
       that need to be made when a conversion involves both a domestic entity and also a foreign entity
       so that the filings in each jurisdiction take effect at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, when the converting general partnership is a foreign general partnership, it is
       possible that the filing in the foreign jurisdiction will take effect at a different time. For that
       reason, this subsection provides that the conversion will take effect at the later of: (i) when the
       statement of conversion takes effect; and (ii) when the conversion takes effect under the law of
       the foreign jurisdiction. This rule avoids the possibility that the conversion will take effect in this
       state before it takes effect in the foreign jurisdiction, which would produce the undesirable result
       that the converting domestic general partnership would cease to appear as an active entity on the
       records of this state before appearing as its active, converted self on the records of the foreign jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is necessary for the filing office to record only the effective date of the statement of
       conversion, and the filing office does not need to be concerned with the effective date of the
       conversion itself. Persons wishing to determine the effective date of a conversion involving both
       a domestic general partnership and a foreign entity will be able to do so by consulting the records
       of the filing offices in each jurisdiction.

      <p>
       A converted entity is the same entity as it was before the conversion; the entity just has a
       different legal form.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection states the principal legal effects of a conversion. The
       converted entity remains the owner of all real and personal property and remains subject to all
       the liabilities, actual or contingent, of the converted entity. A conversion is not a conveyance,
       transfer, or assignment. A conversion does not give rise to: (i) claims of reverter or impairment of
       title based on a prohibited conveyance or transfer; or (ii) to a claim that a contract with the
       converting entity is no longer in effect on the ground of nonassignability, unless the contract
       specifically provides that it does not survive a conversion. The contract rights that remain in the
       converted entity include, without limitation, the right to enforce subscription agreements for
       interests and obligations to make capital contributions entered into or incurred before the
       conversion.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a conversion becomes effective, the internal affairs of the converting entity are no
       longer governed by its former organic law but instead by the organic law of the converted entity.
       As a result, filings that may have been made under the organic law of the converting entity, such
       as the following, will no longer be effective: a statement of qualification as a limited liability
       partnership under UPA (1997) (Last Amended 2013) § 901, a statement of partnership authority
       under Section 303 of that act, a statement of authority under Section of the ULLCA (2006) (Last
       Amended 2013) § 302, or under Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act (2008)
       (Last Amended 2013) § 7.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(5)
       </b>
       —All pending proceedings involving the converting entity are
       continued. The name of the converted entity may be, but need not be, substituted in any pending
       proceeding for the name of the converting entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides the rule for future interest holder liability and
       parallels provisions in Parts 2 (mergers), 3 (interest exchanges), and 5 (domestications).
       See
    the
       comment to Section 1126(c).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —Subsection (d) provides the rule for past interest holder liability and
       parallels analogous provisions in Parts 2 (mergers), 3 (interest exchanges), and 5
       (domestications).
       See
    the comment to Section 1126(d).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —For this provision to apply, the converting entity must have been a
       domestic general partnership. When a domestic general partnership becomes a foreign entity as a
       result of a conversion, some mechanism is needed to facilitate the enforcement of claims by the
       creditors and interest holders of the converting partnership. This subsection, which parallels
       analogous provisions in Parts 2 (mergers) and 5 (domestications), authorizes service of process
       for all such claims in this state.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (g)
       </b>
       —When a conversion takes effect, the entity continues to exist—simply in
       a different form. This subsection thus makes clear that the conversion does not require the entity to wind up its affairs and does not constitute or cause the dissolution of the entity.

      </h4>
      <p>
       A domestication authorized by Part 5 of Article 11 differs from a conversion in that a
       domestication requires that the domesticating entity be the same type of entity as the
       domesticated entity. In a conversion, by contrast, the converting entity changes its type.
      </p>
      <p>
       As with a conversion, all rights and privileges, debts, obligations and other liabilities, and
       actions or proceedings of a domesticating entity remain vested in the domesticated entity. A
       domestication is not a sale, transfer, assignment, or conveyance and does not give rise to a claim
       of reverter or impairment of title.
       See
    the comment to Section 1146(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       Part 5 of Article 11 governs the legal effect of a foreign limited liability partnership
       domesticating in this state. On the other hand, the organic laws of the foreign jurisdiction, and
       not Part 5, will govern the legal effect of most aspects of a domestication of a domestic limited
       liability partnership in another jurisdiction. In the latter scenario, Part 5 authorizes the
       domestication of the domestic entity in the foreign jurisdiction, but Part 5 does not create a right in the domestic entity to be received in the foreign jurisdiction. Similarly, this section does not
       provide a right on the part of a foreign limited liability partnership to become a domestic limited
       liability partnership if the domestication is not authorized by the laws of the foreign jurisdiction.
       If the foreign jurisdiction does not authorize a domestication transaction, the same results can be
       accomplished by forming a new limited liability partnership in this state and merging the existing
       foreign limited liability partnership into the new domestic limited liability partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —Unlike the Parts 2 (merger), 3 (interest exchange), and 4 (conversion),
       Part 5 applies only to limited liability partnerships. However, a non-LLP general partnership that
       seeks to change its governing law may:
      </p>
      <p>
       • amend its partnership agreement to specify the governing law of the desired jurisdiction,
       if the partnership intends to remain non-LLP; or
      </p>
      <p>
       • deliver to the filing office in the desired jurisdiction a statement of qualification, if the
       partnership intends not only to change its governing law but also to become an LLP.

       This section sets forth the requirements for the plan of domestication for a domestic
       limited liability partnership seeking to become a limited liability partnership existing under the
       law of another jurisdiction. For a foreign limited liability partnership seeking to become a
       domestic limited liability partnership, the organic law of the foreign limited liability partnership
       governs the requirements for a plan of domestication. The content of a plan of domestication is
       similar to the content of a plan of merger.
       See
    Section 1122.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —The requirements stated in this subsection are mandatory.

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(3)
       </b>
       —Interest holders in the domesticating limited liability partnership may
       receive interests or other securities of the domesticated limited liability partnership or any other
       entity, obligations, rights to acquire interests or other securities, cash, or other property.

      <p>
       Regardless of whether a domestic limited liability partnership is the domesticating or
       domesticated entity:
      </p>
      <p>
       • This section applies and, therefore, a foreign limited liability partnership seeking to
       domesticate and thereby become a domestic LLP must comply with this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The organic law of the foreign LLP’s jurisdiction must also be consulted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The filing of a statement of domestication makes the transaction a matter of public
       record.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection sets forth the requirements for a statement of
       domestication. They are essentially the same as the requirements for a statement of merger in
       Section 1125.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —A plan of domestication can be used as a substitute for the statement of
       domestication so long as the plan satisfies the requirements in Subsection (b).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f)
       </b>
       —Section 114 determines when a record delivered for filing under this act
       becomes effective. A statement of domestication may specify a delayed effective time and date,
       subject to the ninety-day limit stated in Section 114(3) and (4).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the statement of domestication becomes effective under this subsection, the
       domestication transaction occurs if the domesticated entity is a domestic limited liability
       partnership. A domestication in which the domesticated entity is a foreign limited liability
       partnership will usually also take effect when the statement of domestication takes effect because
       the best practice will be to coordinate the filings that need to be made in each jurisdiction so that
       they take effect at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, when the domesticated general partnership is a foreign general partnership, it is
       possible that the filing in the foreign jurisdiction will take effect at a different time. For that
       reason, this subsection provides that the domestication will take effect at the later of: (i) when the
       statement of domestication takes effect; and (ii) when the domestication takes effect under the
       law of the foreign jurisdiction. This rule avoids the possibility that the domestication will take
       effect in this state before it takes effect in the foreign jurisdiction, which would produce the
       undesirable result that the domesticating domestic general partnership would cease to appear as
       an active entity on the records of this state before appearing as its active, domesticated self on the
       records of the foreign jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is necessary for the filing office to record only the effective date of the statement of
       domestication, and the filing office does not need to be concerned with the effective date of the
       domestication itself. Persons wishing to determine the effective date of a domestication will be
       able to do so by consulting the records of the filing offices in each jurisdiction.

       <b>
        Subsection (a)(1)
       </b>
       —The domesticated entity is the same entity as the domesticating
       entity; it has merely changed its jurisdiction of formation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —A domestication is not a sale, conveyance, transfer, or assignment
       and does not give rise to claims of reverter or impairment of title that may be based on a
       prohibition on transfer, assignment, or conveyance.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(4)
       </b>
       —All pending proceedings involving the domesticating entity are
       continued. The name of the domesticated entity may be, but need not be, substituted in any
       pending proceeding for the name of the domesticating entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(8)
       </b>
       —The interests of the domesticating limited liability partnership are
       reclassified into whatever rights were negotiated in the domestication and the partners and
       transferees of the domesticating LLP are entitled only to those rights. Paragraph 8, on its face, allows for certain partners of the domesticating LLP to be entitled to a continuing equity interest
       in the domesticated LLP whereas other partners of the domesticating LLP may be cashed out as a
       result of the transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides the rule for future interest holder liability and
       parallels analogous provisions in Parts 2 (mergers), 3 (interest exchanges), and 4 (conversions).
       See
    the comment to Section 1126(c).

        Subsection (d)

       parallels analogous provisions in Parts 2 (mergers), 3 (interest exchanges), and 4 (conversions).

    the comments to Sections 1126(d) and 1146(d).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —When a domestic domesticating limited liability partnership becomes a
       foreign LLP as a result of a domestication, some mechanism is needed to facilitate the
       enforcement of claims by the creditors and interest holders of the domesticating LLP. This
       subsection, which parallels analogous provisions in Parts 2 (mergers) and 4 (conversions),
       authorizes service of process for all such claims in this state.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (g)
       </b>
       —When a domestication takes effect, the entity continues to exist— simply as a domestic entity under the laws of a different state. This subsection thus makes clear
       that the domestication does not require the limited liability partnership to wind up its affairs and
       does not constitute or cause the dissolution of the limited liability partnership.

       This section continues prior law after the effective date of this act with respect to rights
       accrued and proceedings. But for this section, the new law of this act would displace the old laws
       in some circumstances. The power of a new act to displace the old statute with respect to conduct
       occurring before the new act’s enactment is substantial. Millard H. Ruud,
       The Savings Clause— Some Problems in Construction and Drafting
    ,
       33
       Tex. L. Rev. 285, 286–93 (1955). A court
       generally applies the law that exists at the time it acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, this act will apply all to pre-existing general partnerships—whether by choice
       under Section 110(a)(2) (permitting an early opt-in), or without choice on the “all-inclusive
       date.” Section 110(b). In this context, the phrase “before [the effective date of this [act]]” should
       be understood as referring to the date upon which this act becomes applicable to the particular
       general partnership at issue.

       A domestic limited partnership may convert to a corporation, a business trust or association, a real estate investment trust, a common-law trust, or any other unincorporated business or entity including a partnership, whether general or limited (including a registered limited-liability partnership) or a limited-liability company, organized, formed, or created under the laws of the state of Rhode Island, upon the authorization of that conversion in accordance with this section. If the partnership agreement specified the manner of authorizing a conversion of the limited partnership, the conversion shall be authorized as specified in the partnership agreement. If the partnership agreement does not specify the manner of authorizing a conversion of the limited partnership and does not prohibit a conversion of the limited partnership, the conversion shall be authorized in the same manner as is specified in the partnership agreement for authorizing a merger or consolidation that involves the limited partnership as a constituent party to the merger or consolidation. If the partnership agreement does not specify the manner of authorizing a conversion of the limited partnership or a merger or consolidation that involved the limited partnership as a constituent party and does not prohibit a conversion of the limited partnership, the conversion shall be authorized by the approval (1) by all general partners, and (2) by the limited partners or, if there is more than one class or group of limited partners, then by each class or group of limited partners, in either case, by limited partners who own more than fifty percent (50%) of the then current percentage or other interest in the profits of the domestic limited partnership owned by all of the limited partners or by the limited partners in each class or group, as appropriate.

       If a limited partnership shall convert in accordance with this section to another entity or business form organized, formed, or created under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the state of Rhode Island or to a Rhode Island unincorporated “other entity”, a certificate of conversion to a non-Rhode Island entity shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state. The certificate of conversion to a non-Rhode Island entity shall state:
       <ol type="1">
        <li id="t07c13s7-13-8.2ol1b1">
         The name of the limited partnership and, if it has been changed, the name under which its certificate of formation was originally filed;

The rights, privileges, powers, and interests in property of the limited partnership that has converted, as well as the debts, liabilities and duties of such limited partnership, shall not be deemed, as a consequence of the conversion, to have been transferred to the other entity or business form to which such limited partnership has converted for any purpose of the laws of the state of Rhode Island.

       Assignee who failed to file an Amendment to Partnership Agreement with the Office of the Secretary of State to transfer the legal title of the partnership interest, at most, holds an unperfected, unrecorded equitable interest (by way of assignment) in the general partnership interest. The trustee in bankruptcy, as a hypothetical bona fide purchaser of real property for value, without actual or constructive notice, takes title free from such unrecorded equitable interests. Although as between the original parties the transfer might be valid and enforceable, as against the trustee, the assignee’s interest in the partnership is clearly subordinate. WFC Realty Co. v.

      Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partnership interest is assignable in whole or in part. An assignment of a partnership interest does not dissolve a limited partnership or entitle the assignee to become or to exercise any rights of a partner. An assignment entitles the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, only the distribution to which the assignor would be entitled. Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partner ceases to be a partner upon assignment of all his partnership interest.

      On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a partner, the court may charge the partnership interest of the partner with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest. To the extent charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee of the partnership interest. This chapter does not deprive any partner of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to his or her partnership interest.

     <p>
      When all fees and taxes have been paid to the tax administrator, as evidenced by an appropriate certificate of good standing issued by the Rhode Island division of taxation, a foreign limited partnership may cancel its registration by filing with the secretary of state a certificate of cancellation signed and sworn to by a general partner. In filing a certificate of cancellation, the foreign limited partnership revokes the authority of its registered agent to accept service of process and consents that service of process in any action, suit or proceeding based upon any cause of action arising in this state during the time the foreign limited partnership was authorized to transact business in this state may subsequently be made on the foreign limited partnership by service on the secretary of state. The certificate of cancellation must include the post office address to which the secretary of state may mail a copy of any process against the foreign limited partnership that is served on the secretary of state.

        “Certificate of limited partnership” [(1)]
       </b>
       – Until the 1985 amendments to the Revised
       Uniform Limited Partnership Act (1976), the certificate of limited partnership contained
       significant information about the limited partnership and the relationship among the partners.
       Consistent with the 1985 amendments and ULPA (2001), under this act the certificate: (i) merely
       reflects the existence of a limited partnership (rather than being the locus for important
       governance rules); and (ii) is significantly different from articles of incorporation, which have a
       substantially greater power to affect
       inter se
    rules for the corporate entity and its owners. For the
       relationship between the certificate of limited partnership and the partnership agreement, see Section 107(d).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Contribution” [(2)]
       </b>
       – This definition serves to distinguish capital contributions from
       other circumstances under which a partner or would-be partner might provide benefits to a
       limited partnership (
    e.g.
    , providing services to the partnership as an employee or independent
       contractor, leasing property to the partnership).
      </p>
      <p>
       This definition also distinguishes “contributions” from capital raised from transferees
       who invest; to be a contribution, the property or benefit must be “provided by a person … to
       become a partner or in the person’s capacity as a partner. This distinction is ubiquitous in the law
       of unincorporated business organizations.
       See, e.g.
    ,
       N.Y. Ltd. Liab. Co. Law § 102(f)
       (McKinney 2013) (“‘Contribution’ means any cash, property, services rendered, or a promissory note or other binding obligation to contribute cash or property or to render services that a
       member contributes to a limited liability company in his or her capacity as a member.”).
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, partnership agreements sometimes provide for contributions from transferees.
       In such circumstances, the default rules for liquidating distributions should be altered
       accordingly.
       See
    Section 810(b)(1) (referring to distributions to be made “to each person owning
       a transferable interest that reflects
       <i>
        contributions
       </i>
       made and not previously returned”) (emphasis
       added).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Distribution” [(4)(A) – redemptions included]
       </b>
       – This provision specifically refers to
       transactions between a limited partnership and one of its partners, which in the corporate context
       would be labeled a “redemption.” This paragraph has subparts because ownership interests in a
       partnership are conceptually bifurcated into economic rights (“transferable interest) and
       governance and information rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 503(a), “[a]ny distribution made by a limited partnership before its
       dissolution and winding up must be shared among the partners on the basis of the value, as stated
       in the required information when the limited partnership decides to make the distribution, of the
       contributions the limited partnership has received from each partner….” Since a redemption is a
       distribution, absent authorization in the partnership agreement a limited partnership may not
       redeem the interest of one partner or transferee without redeeming (or at least offering to redeem)
       the interests of all other partners and transferees to a comparable extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The law of close corporations has flirted with a similar notion.
       See, e.g., Donahue v. Rodd
       Electrotype Co. of New England, Inc.
    , 367 Mass. 578, 598, 328 N.E.2d 505, 518 (1975) (stating,
       with regard to closely held corporations, “if the stockholder whose shares were purchased was a
       member of the controlling group, the controlling stockholders must cause the corporation to offer
       each stockholder an equal opportunity to sell a ratable number of his shares to the corporation at
       an identical price”);

       </i>
       , 304 Md. 256, 273, 498 A.2d 642, 650
       (1985) (rejecting the “per se breach of duty” approach);
       <i>

       </i>
       ,
       370 Mass. 842, 850, 353 N.E.2d 657, 663 (1976) (stating that “untempered application of the
       strict good faith standard enunciated in
       <i>
        Donahue
       </i>
       to … will result in the imposition of limitations
       on legitimate action by the controlling group in a close corporation which will unduly hamper its
       effectiveness in managing the corporation in the best interests of all concerned”).
      </p>
      <p>
       A partnership agreement can override Section 503(a)’s proportional treatment
       requirement without specifically mentioning redemptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A limited partnership agreement: (i) includes a list (the “protected list”) of
       decisions or actions that may be taken only with the consent of all the general partners
       and 2/3 of the interests owned by the limited partners; and (ii) provides that all other
       decisions and acts may be taken as the general partners determine. The protected list
       does not include redemptions. The partnership agreement overrides Section 503(a)’s
       proportional treatment requirement.
      </p>

       <b>
        [(4)(B) – exclusion]
       </b>
       – This exclusion affects the reach of: (i) Section 505’s clawback
       20 provisions; and (ii) the charging order remedy under Section 703. The effect on the clawback
       provision reflects the law in several states,
       see, e.g.
    ,
       Del. Code Ann. tit. 6 § 17-607(a) (2012)
       and
       V.A. Code § 153.210(b) (2012), and makes sense conceptually and as a matter of policy.

        “Foreign limited partnership” [(6)]
       </b>
       – This definition intends a flexible, comparative
       approach. If a particular type of foreign entity has key legal characteristics that approximate the
       essential legal characteristics of a domestic limited partnership, that particular type of foreign
       entity is a foreign limited partnership under this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “General partner” [(7)]
       </b>
       – A partnership agreement may vary Section 401 and provide a
       process or mechanism for becoming a general partner that is different from or additional to the
       rules stated in that section.
       See
    Section 401(b)(1). For the purposes of this definition, a person
       who becomes a general partner pursuant to a provision of the partnership agreement “become[s] a general partner under Section 401.” After a person has been dissociated as a general partner,
       Section 603, the term “general partner” continues to apply to the person’s conduct while a
       general partner.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 605(b).

       <b>
        “Jurisdiction of formation” [(9)]
       </b>

       jurisdictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Limited liability limited partnership” [(10)]
       </b>
       – Typically, a general partnership
       becomes a limited liability partnership when the filing office files a statement of qualification
       submitted by the partnership. In contrast, LLLP status results from a statement in a limited
       partnership’s certificate of limited partnership. Section 201(b)(5) requires a limited partnership’s
       certificate of limited partnership to state “whether the limited partnership is a limited liability
       limited partnership.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition makes an exception for Article 11, because in that article the phrase
       “limited liability limited partnership” encompasses both domestic and foreign LLLPs.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Limited partner” [(11)]
       </b>
       – This definition parallels the definition of “general partner”
       and the comment to Paragraph 7 applies here as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Limited partnership” [(12)]
       </b>
       – This definition makes no reference to a limited
       partnership having partners upon formation, but Section 201(d) does.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Partnership agreement” [(14)]
       </b>
       – This definition must be read in conjunction with
       Sections 105 through 107, which further describe the partnership agreement. In particular,
       although this definition refers to “the agreement … of all the partners,” the limited partnership
       itself is bound by and may enforce the agreement. Section 106(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       A partnership agreement is a contract, and therefore all statutory language pertaining to
       the partnership agreement must be understood in the context of the law of contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition in Paragraph 14 is very broad and recognizes a wide scope of authority for
       the partnership agreement: “the matters described in Section 105(a).” Those matters include not
       only all relations
       inter se
    the partners and the partnership but also “the activities and affairs of the
       partnership and the conduct of those activities and affairs.” Section 105(a)(2). Moreover, the
       definition puts no limits on the form of the partnership agreement. To the contrary, the definition
       contains the phrase “whether oral, implied, in a record, or in any combination thereof.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless the partnership agreement itself provides otherwise:
      </p>
      <p>
       • a partnership agreement may comprise a number of separate documents (or records),
       however denominated; and
      </p>
      <p>
       • subject to Section 106(b) (deeming new partners to assent to the then-existing
       partnership agreement), a document, record, understanding, etc. can be part of the
       partnership agreement only with the assent of all persons then partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       An agreement among less than all partners might well be enforceable among those
       partners as parties, but would not be part of the partnership agreement. However, under Section
       105(a)(3), an amendment to a partnership agreement can be made with less than unanimous
       consent if the partnership agreement itself so provides.
      </p>
      <p>
       An agreement to form a limited partnership is not itself a partnership agreement. The
       term “partnership agreement” presupposes “partners,” and a person cannot be a partner in a
       partnership before the partnership exists. However, as soon as a limited partnership comes into
       existence, it perforce has a partnership agreement. For example, suppose: (i) two persons,
       Gamma and Lambda, orally and informally agree to join their activities through a limited
       partnership, in which Gamma will be the general partner and Lambda the limited partner; (ii) an
       appropriate certification of limited partnership is delivered to the filing office, which files the
       certificate; (iii) Gamma and Lambda become respectively the general and limited partner; and
       (iv) the limited partnership is thus formed under Section 201(d). A partnership agreement exists.
       In the words of Paragraph 14 “all the partners” have agreed who the partners are, that, as “all the
       partners” they will conduct a business, and that Gamma will be the managing partner and
       Lambda will be more or less passive. That agreement – no matter how informal or rudimentary
       – is an agreement “concerning the matters described in Section 105(a).” To the extent the
       agreement does not provide the
       inter se
    “rules of the game,” the “default rules” of this act “fill in
       the gaps.” Section 105(b).
      </p>
      <p>
       This act states no rule as to whether the statute of frauds applies to partnership
       agreements. Case law suggests that the answer is yes:
      </p>
      
      <p>
       Partnership agreements, like other contracts, are subject to the Statute of Frauds. A contract of partnership for a term exceeding one year is within the Statute of Frauds and is void unless it is in writing [and signed by the party to be bound]; however, a contract establishing a partnership terminable at the will of any partner 22 is generally held to be capable of performance by its terms within one year of its making and, therefore, to be outside the Statute of Frauds.

      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, the land provision does not apply to a partner’s interest in a partnership, no
       matter how much the partnership owns or deals in real property. Interests in a partnership are
       personal property and reflect no direct interest in the entity’s assets. See Sections 102(24) and
       701. Thus, the real property issues pertaining to a partnership ownership of land do not “flow
       through” to the partners and partnership interests.
       See, e.g., Wooten v. Marshall
    , 153 F. Supp.

      <p>
       <b>
        “Transfer” [(24)]
       </b>
       – The term “transfer” is broadly defined to include all types of
       conveyances of interests in property. The reference to “transfer by operation of law” is
       significant in connection with Section 702 (Transfer of Transferable Interest). That section
       23 severely restricts a transferee’s rights (absent the consent of the partners), and this definition
       makes those restrictions applicable, for example, to transfers ordered by a family court as part of
       a divorce proceeding and transfers resulting from the death of a partner. The restrictions also
       apply to transfers in the context of a partner’s bankruptcy, except to the extent that bankruptcy
       law supersedes this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Transferable interest” [(25)]
       </b>
       – Absent a contrary provision in the partnership

       partnership which can be transferred.
       See
    Section 702.

      <p>
       This act defines “[t]ransferable interest” as an interest “initially owned by a person in the
       person’s capacity as a partner,” because this act does not contemplate a limited partnership directly creating interests that comprise only economic rights.
       See

      </h4>
      <p>
       Three aspects of this section warrant particular note. First, this section is substantially
       slimmer than the corresponding provisions of previous uniform acts pertaining to business
       organizations: UPA (1997), ULLCA (1996), and ULPA (2001). Each of those acts borrowed
       heavily from the comparable provision of the Uniform Commercial Code. This act relies instead on generally applicable principles of agency law, see Section 113, although Subsection (f) does
       provide a rule for attributing to a partnership knowledge or notice possessed by a general partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the section contains no generally applicable provisions determining when an
       organization is charged with knowledge or notice, because those imputation rules: (i) comprise
       core topics within the law of agency; (ii) are very complicated; (iii) should not have any different
       content under this act than in other circumstances; and (iv) are the subject of considerable
       attention in the
       Restatement (Third) of Agency (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, this act does not define “notice” to include “knowledge.” Although
       conceptualizing the latter as giving the former makes logical sense and has a long pedigree, that
       conceptualization is counter-intuitive for the uninitiated. In ordinary usage, notice has a meaning
       separate from knowledge. This act follows ordinary usage and therefore contains some
       references to “knowledge or notice.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       – In this context, the most important source of “law other than this
       [act]” is the common law of agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)
       </b>
       – The “facts known to the person at the time in question” include facts
       the person is deemed to know under Subsection (a)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       – As for the significance of constructive notice “that the partnership is a
       limited partnership,” see
       Water, Waste &amp; Land, Inc. v. Lanham
    , 955 P.2d 997, 1001 1003 (Colo.
       1998) (interpreting a comparable provision of the Colorado LLC statute and holding the
       provision ineffective to change common law agency principles, including the rules relating to the
       liability of an agent that transacts business for an undisclosed principal).
      </p>
      <p>
       As for constructive notice that “the persons designated in the certificate as general
       partners are general partners,” Section 201(b)(4) requires the initial certificate of limited
       partnership to name each general partner, and Section 202(d) requires a limited partnership to
       promptly amend its certificate of limited partnership to reflect any change in the identity of its
       general partners. Nonetheless, it will be possible, albeit improper, for a person to be designated
       in the certificate of limited partnership as a general partner without having become a general
       partner as contemplated by Section 401. Likewise, it will be possible for a person to have
       become a general partner under Section 401 without being designated as a general partner in the
       certificate of limited partnership. According to the last clause of this subsection, the fact that a
       person is not listed in the certificate as a general partner is not notice that the person is not a
       general partner. For further discussion of this point, see Section 401, comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the partnership agreement and the public record are inconsistent, the partnership
       agreement prevails as to
       inter se
    matters and the record prevails as to third parties who have
       reasonably relied on it. Section 107(d).
       <i>
        See also
       </i>
       Sections 202(d) (requiring the limited
       partnership to amend its certificate of limited partnership to keep accurate the listing of general
       partners), 202(e) (requiring a general partner to take corrective action when the general partner
       knows that the certificate of limited partnership contains false information), and 205 (imposing
       liability for false information in,
       <i>
        inter alia
       </i>
       , the certificate of limited partnership).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       – This subsection provides constructive notice of facts stated in specified
       filed public records. The subsection works in conjunction with other sections of this act to
       curtail the power to bind and personal liability of general partners and persons dissociated as
       general partners.
       See
    Sections 402, 606, 607, 804, and 805. The constructive notice begins
       ninety days after the effective date of the filed record. For the act’s rules on delayed effective
       dates, see Section 207.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 90-day delay applies only to the constructive notice and not to the event described in
       the filed record.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: On March 15, X dissociates as a general partner from XYZ Limited
       Partnership by giving notice to XYZ.
       See
    Section 603(1). On March 20, XYZ amends
       its certificate of limited partnership to remove X’s name from the list of general partners.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 202(d)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       X’s dissociation is effective March 15. If on March 16 X purports to be a general partner
       of XYZ and under Section 606(a) binds XYZ to some obligation, X will be liable under
       Section 606(b) as a “person dissociated as a general partner.”
      </p>
      <p>
       On June 19 (90 days after March 20), the world has constructive notice of X’s
       dissociation as a general partner. Beginning on that date, X will lack the power to bind
       XYZ.
       See
    Section 606(a)(2)(B) (providing that a person dissociated as a general partner
       can bind the limited partnership only if,
       <i>
        inter alia
       </i>
       , “at the time the other party enters into
       the transaction … the other party does not know or have notice of the dissociation”).
      </p>
      <p>
       Constructive notice under this subsection applies to partners and transferees as well as
       other persons.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       – If a person “notifies” another person of a fact, the other person has
       “reason to know” the fact and therefore has notice under Subsection (b)(1). However, a person
       can have “notice” of a fact without having been “notifie[d]” of the fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 210(f) pertains to delivery of records

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f)
       </b>
       – This subsection states the rule for imputing a partner’s knowledge or
       notice to the partnership. Under this subsection and Section 302, information possessed by a
       person that is only a limited partner is not attributable to the limited partnership. However,
       information possessed by a person that is both a general partner and a limited partner is
       attributable to the limited partnership.

    Section 109 (Dual Capacity). For a discussion of
       agency law principles analogous to “fraud on the partnership,” see

       <b>
        Paragraph (1)
       </b>
       – Like any other legal concept, “internal affairs” may be indeterminate at
       its edges. However, the concept certainly includes interpretation and enforcement of the
       partnership agreement, relations among the partners as partners, and relations between the
       limited partnership and its partners.
       Compare
    Section 104,
       <i>
        with
       </i>
       Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 302 cmt. a (1971) (defining “internal affairs” with reference to a
       corporation as “the relations inter se of the corporation, its shareholders, directors, officers or
       agents”).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Internal affairs” do not encompass the power
       vel non
    of a person to bind a limited
       partnership.
       Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 292(2) (1971) (“The principal
       will be held bound by the agent's action if he would so be bound under the local law of the state
       where the agent dealt with the third person, provided at least that the principal had authorized the
       agent to act on his behalf in that state or had led the third person reasonably to believe that the
       agent had such authority.” );
       <i>
        Id.
       </i>
       § 295(1) (“Whether a partnership is bound by action taken on its
       behalf by an agent in dealing with a third person is determined by the local law of the state
       selected by application of the rule of § 292.”);
       Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws §
       345 cmt. c (1934) (Law Governing Effect of Act of Agent or Partner) (“If … the principal or
       partner sends the agent or other partner into a state to act on his behalf, he assumes the risk of
       liability not only for authorized but for unauthorized conduct of the agent or partner in
       accordance with the law of that state.”).

      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement cannot alter this Section.
       See
    Section 105(c)(1). However,
       partnership agreement may lawfully incorporate by reference the provisions of another state’s
       limited partnership statute. If done correctly, this incorporation makes the foreign statutory
       language part of the partnership agreement, and the incorporated terms (together with the rest of
       the partnership agreement) then govern the partners (and those claiming through the partners) to
       the extent not prohibited by this act.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 105. This approach: (i) does
       <span class="s1">
        not
       </span>
       switch the
       limited partnership’s governing law to that of another state; (ii) instead takes the provisions of
       another state’s law and incorporates them by reference into the contract among the partners; (iii)
       raises complex drafting issues –
       <i>
        e.g.
       </i>
       , how to address subsequent changes to the incorporated law
       (whether occurring by statutory amendment or court decision); and (iv) thus is rarely, if ever, a
       good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (2)
       </b>
       – This paragraph obviously encompasses Sections 303 (the liability shield
       for limited partners) and 404(c) (the shield for general partners in a limited liability limited
       partnership), but does not necessarily encompass a claim that a partner is liable to a third party
       for: (i) having purported to bind a limited partnership to the third party; or (ii) having committed
       a tort against the third party while acting on a limited partnership’s behalf or in the course of the
       partnership’s business. That liability is not by status (
    i.e.
    , not partner as a partner) but rather results from function or conduct.
       <i>
        Cf.
       </i>
       § 302(b) (stating that, although this act does not make a
       limited partner as limited partner the agent of a limited partnership, other law may make a
       limited partnership liable for the conduct of a limited partner).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Internal affairs” and the “liability of a partner as a partner” are mentioned separately
       because it can be argued that the liability of partners to third parties is not an internal affair.
       See,
       e.g.
    ,
       Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, § 307 (1971) (treating shareholders’
       liability separately from the internal affairs doctrine). A few cases subsume owner/manager
       liability into internal affairs, but many do not.
       <i>
        See, e.g., Kalb, Voorhis &amp; Co. v. American Fin.
        Corp.
       </i>
       , 8 F.3d 130, 132 (2nd Cir. 1993) (holding that the corporation’s “primary purpose is to
       insulate shareholders from legal liability” and therefore “the state of incorporation has the greater
       interest in determining when and if that insulation is to be stripped away”) (quoting

       , 756 F. Supp. 126, 131 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (internal
       quotation marks omitted).
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, most (if not all) limited partnership statutes follow the rule stated in this
       paragraph.
       See
    RULPA (1976/1985) § 901 (stating that “the laws of the state under which a
       foreign limited partnership is organized govern its organization and internal affairs and the
       liability of its limited partners”); ULPA (2001) § 901 (same, but as to all partners).

       The Harmonization Project rewrote this section to conform, for the most part, to the corresponding section of ULLCA (2006) (Last Amended).

      <p>
       Principal Provisions of the Act Concerning the Partnership Agreement
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement is pivotal to a limited partnership, and Sections 105 through 107 are pivotal to this act. They must be read together, along with Section 102(14) (defining the partnership agreement).
      </p>
      <p>
       This Section performs five essential functions. Subsection (a) establishes the primacy of the partnership agreement in establishing relations
       inter se
    the limited partnership and its partners. Subsection (b) recognizes this act as comprising mostly default rules –
       <i>
        i.e.
       </i>
       , gap fillers for issues as to which the partnership agreement provides no rule. Subsection (c) lists the few mandatory provisions of the act. Subsection (d) lists some provisions frequently found in partnership agreements, authorizing some provisions unconditionally and other provisions so long as “not manifestly unreasonable.” Subsection (e) delineates in detail both the meaning of “not manifestly unreasonable” and the information relevant to a determining a claim that a provision of a partnership agreement is manifestly unreasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 106 details the effect of a partnership agreement on the limited partnership and on persons becoming partners. Section 107 concerns the effect of a partnership agreement on third parties.
      </p>

       Role and Inevitability of Partnership Agreement
      </p>
      <p>
       “A limited partnership is a creature of both statute and contract.”
       Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. v. Cantor
    , CIV.A. 18101, 2001 WL 1456494 at *5 (Del. Ch. Nov. 5, 2001);
       <i>
        Gottsacker v. Monnier
       </i>
       , 281 Wis. 2d 361, 370, 697 N.W.2d 436, 440 (2005) (stating that “from the partnership form, the LLC borrows … internal governance by contract”), and Section 102(14) delineates a very broad scope for “partnership agreement.” As a result, once a limited partnership comes into existence and has at least one general partner and one limited partner, a partnership agreement necessarily exists.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 102(14), cmt. Accordingly, this act refers to “the partnership agreement” rather than “a partnership agreement.” This phrasing should not, however, be read to require a limited partnership or its partners to take any formal action to adopt a partnership agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subject only to Subsections (c) and (d), the partnership agreement has plenary power to structure and regulate the relations of the partners
       inter se
    . Although the certificate of limited partnership is a limited partnership’s foundational document, among the partners the partnership agreement controls.
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement is the exclusive consensual process for modifying this act’s various default rules pertaining to relationships
       inter se
    the partners and between the partners and the limited partnership. Section 105(b). The partnership agreement also has power over “[t]he obligations of a limited partnership and its partners to a person in the person’s capacity as a transferee or a person dissociated as a partner.” Section 107(b). For the relationship between the partnership agreement and certificate of limited partnership,
       <i>

       Section 107(d).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Partnership Agreement and the Fiduciary and Other Duties of the General Partner
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most complex questions in the law of unincorporated business organizations is the extent to which an agreement among the organization’s owners can affect the fiduciary and other duties of those who manage the organization – in the case of a limited partnership, the general partner (or partners). As explained in detail in the comment to Subsection (d)(3), this act rejects the notion that a contract can completely transform an inherently fiduciary relationship into a merely arm’s length association. Within that limitation, however, this section provides substantial power to the partnership agreement to reshape, limit, and eliminate fiduciary and other managerial duties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) recognizes that the partnership agreement is the map to the parties’ deal and that any claim by a partner of managerial misconduct must be assessed first under the relevant terms of the partnership agreement. Subsection (d) specifically validates arrangements commonly used to reshape managerial duties and limit the consequences of breaching those duties. Subsection (c) contains relevant limitations, but those limitations: (i) must be read together with Subsection (d); and (ii) do not preclude the partnership agreement fundamentally redesigning the duties applicable to the general partners. For the act’s design of those duties, see Sections 304, 407, and 409.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – This subsection describes the very broad scope of a limited partnership’s partnership agreement, which includes all matters constituting “internal affairs.”
       Compare
    Section 105(a),
       <i>
        with
       </i>
       Section 104(1) (using the phrase “internal affairs” in stating a choice of law rule). This broad grant of authority is subject to the restrictions stated in Subsection (c), including the broad restriction stated in Paragraph (c)(18) (concerning the rights of third parties under this act).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(1)
       </b>
       – This paragraph encompasses all the rights and duties of each partner, including rights and duties pertaining to transactions under Article 11.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(3)
       </b>
       – Under this provision, the partnership agreement can control both the quantum of consent required (
    e.g.
    , majority of partners) and the means by which the consent is manifested (
       <i>
        e.g.
       </i>
       , prohibiting modifications except when consented to in writing).
       <i>
        See also
       </i>
       Section 107(a), cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the partnership agreement does not address the issue, this act provides the rule. Section 407(b)(4)(C) (requiring the affirmative vote or consent of all the partners) and 407(c)(3)(C) (same). Under Section 111 (supplemental principles of law), the parol evidence rule will apply to a written partnership agreement when appropriate under contract law.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – To the extent the partnership agreement does not determine an

       Sometimes – but not always – the Comments to this act refer to a variable provision as a “default rule” and a non-waivable provision as “mandatory.” These references are merely to draw attention to the default/mandatory distinction in particular contexts and have neither the intent nor the power to affect the default/mandatory status of provisions of this act whose comments lack a comparable reference.

        Subsection (c)(1)
       </b>
       – Section 104 states that this act provides the law applicable to: (i) the internal affairs of a limited partnership formed under this act; and (ii) the liability of partners for obligations of the limited partnership. The organizers of a limited partnership make this choice of law by choosing to form a limited partnership under this act. Domestication to another jurisdiction will re-set the choice of law,
       see
    Sections 1151–56, but the partnership agreement cannot. The partnership agreement may incorporate wholesale and by reference the provisions of another jurisdiction’s limited partnership statute, but that approach raises complex drafting issues –
       <i>
        e.g.
       </i>
       , how to address future revisions to that statute – and in any event is subject to the strictures of Section 105(c) and (d).

       </i>
       Section 104(1), cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) contains no parallel prohibition on varying Section 1001 (stating the governing law for foreign limited partnerships), because a prohibition is unnecessary. As a matter of fundamental contract law, an agreement among partners of one limited partnership is powerless to govern the affairs of another limited partnership.

        Subsection (c)(2)

        Subsection (c)(4)

        Subsection (c)(5)

       – Because deleting the specified statement exposes each general partner to unlimited liability for each debt, liability, or other obligation of the limited partnership accrued after the deletion: (i) Section 406(b)(2) gives each general partner veto power; and (ii) this subsection makes that power non-waivable.

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(6)

       <b>
        Subsection (c)(7)
       </b>
       – Sections 305(a) and 409(d) refer to the “contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing,” which contract law implies in every contract. The partnership agreement cannot eliminate this obligation, neither in whole (
    i.e.
    , generally) nor in part (
       <i>
        i.e.
       </i>
       , as applicable to specified situations).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, a partnership agreement may “prescribe the standards … by which the performance of the obligation is to be measured.”
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: The partnership agreement of a limited partnership gives the general partner the discretion to cause the limited partnership to enter into contracts with affiliates of the general partner (so-called “Conflict Transactions”). The agreement further provides: “When causing the Limited Partnership to enter into a Conflict Transaction, the general partner complies with Section 409(d) of [this act] if a disinterested person, knowledgeable in the subject matter, states in writing that the terms and conditions of the Transaction are equivalent to the terms and conditions that would be agreed to by persons at arm’s length in comparable circumstances.” This provision “prescribe[s] the standards by which the performance of the [Section 409(d)] obligation is to be measured.”
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Same facts as the previous example, except that, during the performance of a Conflict Transaction, the general partner causes the limited partnership to waive material protections under the applicable contract. The standard stated in the previous example is inapposite to this conduct. Section 409(d) therefore applies to the conduct without any direct contractual delineation. (However, other terms of the agreement may be relevant to determining whether the conduct violates Section 409(d).
       See
    Section 409(d), cmt.)
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: The partnership agreement of a limited partnership gives the general partner “sole discretion” to make various decisions. The agreement further provides: “Whenever this agreement requires or permits a general partner to make a decision that has the potential to benefit one class of partners to the detriment of another class, the general partner complies with Section 409(d) of [this act] if the general partner makes the decision with:
      </p>
      <p>
       a. the honest belief that the decision:
      </p>
      <p>
       i. serves the best interests of the Limited Partnership; or
      </p>
      <p>
       ii. at least does not injure or otherwise disserve those interests; and
      </p>
      <p>
       b. the reasonable belief that the decision breaches no partner’s rights under this agreement.”
      </p>
      <p>
       This provision “prescribe[s] the standards by which the performance of the [Section 409(d)] obligation is to be measured.”

      </p>
      <p>
       A partnership agreement that seeks to prescribe standards for measuring the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing under Section 409(d) should expressly refer to the obligation.

        Subsection (c)(8)
       </b>
       – These restrictions are ubiquitous in the law of business entities and, in conjunction with other provisions of this section, control the otherwise very broad power of a partnership agreement to affect fiduciary and other duties. The restrictions are central to the raft of exculpatory provisions that sprung up in corporate statutes in response to
       Smith v. Van Gorkum
    , 488 A.2d 858 (Del. 1985). Delaware led the response with
       Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 102(b)(7), and a number of LLC statutes have similar provisions.
       <i>
        E.g.
       </i>
       Ga. Code Ann. § 14-11-305(4)(A) (2011). For an extreme example, see
       Va. Code Ann. § 13.1-1025 (B) (2012). In this context, “conduct” includes both acts and omissions.
       Black's Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009) (defining conduct as “[p]ersonal behavior, whether by action or inaction”).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “bad faith" has multiple meanings, and the context determines which meaning applies. In the context of the duty of loyalty, “bad faith” includes conduct motivated by ill will or other intent purposely to harm another person. The concept also includes conduct from which a person derives an improper personal benefit.
       See, e.g., Mroz v. Hoaloha Na Eha, Inc.
    , 410 F. Supp. 2d 919, 936-37 (D. Haw. 2005) (denying a motion to dismiss a claim that “the Majority Partners” were personally liable for the partnership’s wrongful termination of the plaintiff; quoting the complaint as alleging that “the Majority Partners, individually and as a group, acted with malice and/or ill will, and or with an intent to serve their own personal interests and/or without an intent to serve company interests, and/or outside of the scope of their authority and/or without justification”);

      </p>
      <p>
       In the context of the duty of care, the concept of bad faith comes primarily from corporate law and means an extreme breach of the duty–
       i.e.
    , “the failure to exercise “
       <i>
        honest judgment
       </i>
       in the lawful and legitimate furtherance of corporate purposes.”
       <i>

      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, when a plaintiff alleges bad faith as pertaining to the duty of care, “[t]he burden … is to show irrationality: a plaintiff must demonstrate that no reasonable business person could possibly authorize the action in good faith. Put positively, the decision must go so far beyond the bounds of reasonable business judgment that its only explanation is bad faith.”

       <i>
        information that was readily at hand
       </i>
       ”) (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
       With regard to both the duty of loyalty and the duty of care, “bad faith” is entirely distinct from the meaning of “good faith” in the contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
       See
    Section 409(d), cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c)(8) pertains to indirect as well as direct efforts to “relieve or exonerate” and thus limits how far a partnership agreement can go in providing for indemnification.
       See
    Section 408(b) (stating a default rule for indemnification).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this paragraph does not expressly address contracts between a limited partnership and a general partner, the stated constraints must also apply to such contracts. If not, those constraints are effectively meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A limited partnership enters into a management contract with its general partner, and the contract provides the general partner exoneration for liability to the limited partnership even for willful and intentional misconduct. Most likely, contract law will treat the provision as against public policy and therefore unenforceable.
       Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 195(1) (1981) (“A term exempting a party from tort liability for harm caused intentionally or recklessly is unenforceable on grounds of public policy.”). If not, a court should hold the provision unenforceable to avoid evisceration of Subsection (c)(8). (Or, the court could invoke the policy expressed in Subsection (c)(8) as grounds for holding the provision unenforceable under contract law.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(9)
       </b>
       – Although phrased as a restriction, this provision grants substantial power to the partnership agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: The partnership agreement of a limited partnership states “No limited partner may have access to information constituting a trade secret of the Partnership.” This restriction is reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The information required under Section 108 is skeletal, and the partnership agreement can impose reasonable limitations on access to and use of other information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The act also empowers the limited partnership “as a matter within the ordinary course of its activities and affairs [to] impose reasonable restrictions and conditions on access to and use of information” obtained under Section 304 or 407.
       See
    Sections 304(j) and 407(j), cmts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether a restriction is reasonable, a court might consider: (i) the danger or other problem the restriction seeks to avoid; (ii) the purpose for which the information is sought; and (iii) whether, in light of both the problem and the purpose, the restriction is reasonably tailored. Under this act, general and limited partners have sharply different roles. A restriction that is reasonable as to a limited partner is not necessarily reasonable as to a general partner. Restricting a limited partner’s access to or use of the names and addresses of other limited partners is not per se unreasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(11)
       </b>
       – A partnership agreement certainly may make a person’s dissociation as a general partner a breach of contract, but eliminating even the
       power
    to dissociate would contradict the essence of the limited partnership. General partners in a limited partnership are analogous to partners in a general partnership, and the relationship among general partners is at its core a
       <i>
        voluntary
       </i>
       association.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, general partners in a limited partnership provide services not only as fiduciaries but also pursuant to a contract.
       See
    Section 105, cmt. (Role and Inevitability of Partnership Agreement). Only in exceptional circumstances does a party to a contract lack the power to breach, and such circumstances do not exist as to general partners of a limited partnership. Indeed, courts will not enjoin a person to remain in an ongoing contractual relationship that involves trust and confidence.
       E. Allan Farnsworth, Contracts § 12.7 at 781 (3rd ed. 1999) (“A court will not grant specific performance of a contract to provide a service that is personal in nature. This refusal … is based [in part] of the undesirability of compelling the continuance of personal relations after disputes have arisen and confidence and loyalty have been shaken and the undesirability, in some instances, of imposing what might seem like involuntary servitude.”) (footnote omitted).
      </p>
      <p>
       For two reasons this act treats limited partners quite differently. First, to make possible the act a suitable vehicle for family limited partnerships, “[a] person does not have a right to dissociate as a limited partner before the completion of the winding up of the limited partnership.” Section 601(a).
       See also
    Prefatory Note to 2011 Act, “
       <i>
        The Act’s Overall Approach
       </i>
       .”
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the partnership agreement may eliminate a limited partner’s power to dissociate, because limited partners do not resemble contract obligors. Limited partners
       qua
    limited partners provide no services to the limited partnership, and therefore the analysis stated in the second paragraph of this comment does not apply. Moreover, limited partners have no fiduciary duties, Section 305(b), and therefore the analysis stated in the first paragraph of this comment is inapposite as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(12)
       </b>
       – The partnership agreement may not change the stated grounds for judicial dissolution but may determine the forum in which a claim for dissolution under Section 801(a)(6) is determined. For example, arbitration and forum selection clauses are commonplace in business relationships in general and in partnership agreements in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
       The approach of this paragraph differs from the law of Delaware.
       See Huatuco v. Satellite Healthcare
    , CV 8465-VCG, 2013 WL 6460898 at *1 and n.2 (Del. Ch.

       <b>
        Subsection (c)(14)
       </b>
       – Article 9 delineates a partner’s rights to bring direct and derivative actions. It would be unreasonable to frustrate these rights but not unreasonable to channel their exercise. For example, the partnership agreement might select a forum, require pre-suit mediation, provide for arbitration of both direct and derivative claims, or override Section 902 and require “universal demand” in all derivative cases. Similarly, it is not unreasonable to provide for liquidated damages consonant with the law of contracts. In contrast, it would be unreasonable for a partnership agreement to both: (i) require a would-be derivative plaintiff to make demand regardless of futility; and (ii) bar taking the claim to court no matter how long the general partners ponder the demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(15)

       – Section 1123(a)(1), 1133(a)(1), 1143(a)(1), and 1153(a)(1) each requires the consent or the affirmative vote of all partners. The partnership agreement may modify these requirements. In contrast, under the sections stated in this subsection:
      </p>
      <p>
       • each partner is protected from being merged, exchanged, converted, or domesticated “into” the status of a partner in a general partnership that is not a limited liability partnership (or a comparable “unshielded” position in some other organization) without the member having
       directly
    consented to either:
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR

      </p>
      <p>
       • merely consenting to a partnership agreement provision that permits amendment of the agreement with less than unanimous consent of the partners does not qualify as the requisite direct consent.

       <b>
        Subsection (c)(17)
       </b>
       – Because these plans are the basic “deal documents” for each of the organic transactions contemplated in Article 11, the partnership agreement may not vary the contents of these plans.

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(18)
       </b>
       – This limitation pertains only to “the rights under this [act] of” third parties other than partners. Moreover, the limitation is subject to two substantial exceptions: Section 106 (pertaining to the partnership agreement’s relationship to the limited partnership itself and to persons becoming partners) and Section 107(b) (pertaining to the partnership agreement’s power over the rights of transferees).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       – The partnership agreement has plenipotentiary power over the matters described in Subsection (a), except as specifically limited by Subsections (c). However, for the convenience of practitioners and the courts, Paragraphs 1 and 2 list various terms often found in partnership agreements. No negative inference should be drawn about terms not listed; the listing is provided “without limiting other terms that may be included in a partnership agreement.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph 2 lists arrangements subject to the “not manifestly unreasonable standard.” Subsection (e) delineates that standard. The same standard applies to terms of a partnership agreement which seek to “prescribe the standards … by which the performance of the [contractual] obligation [of good faith and fair dealing] is to be measured.” Subsection (c)(7).

       <b>

       – An arrangement
       not
    involving “one or more disinterested and independent persons” acting “after full disclosure of all material facts” would “alter … the aspects of the duty of loyalty stated in Section 409(b)” and would therefore be subject to the “not manifestly unreasonable standard” of Subsection (d)(2)(A).
      </p>

       For the meaning of “material” as applied to information, see Section 409(f), comment.

        Subsection (d)(1)(B)

       – Section 504(a)(2) prohibits distributions:
      </p>
      <p>
       •
    not merely
    when, after the distribution, “the partnership’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities,”
      </p>
      <p>
       •
    but also
    when, after the distribution, the assets would less than the total liabilities “plus the amount that would be needed, if the partnership were to be dissolved and wound up at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution and winding up of partners and transferees whose preferential rights are superior to those of persons receiving the distribution.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The second part of the solvency test pertains to preferential rights to distributions, is thus a matter
       inter se
    the partners and any transferees, and is therefore subject to change in the partnership agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, the first part of the solvency test protects third parties – creditors of the limited partnership – and therefore cannot be changed by the partnership agreement. Section 105(c)(18). Likewise, the partnership agreement cannot change solvency test stated in Section 504(a)(1) (that “the partnership would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of the partnership’s activities and affairs”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Section (d)(2)
       </b>
       – This act rejects the ultra-contractarian notion that fiduciary duty within a business organization is merely a set of default rules and seeks instead to balance the virtues of “freedom of contract” against the dangers that inescapably exist when some have power over the interests of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless, a properly drafted partnership agreement may substantially alter and even eliminate fiduciary duties. Two important limitations exist. First, arrangements subject to this subsection may not be “manifestly unreasonable.”
       See
    Subsection (e) (delineating this standard).
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the partnership agreement may not transform the relationship
       inter se
    the general partners to the limited partnership and limited partners into an entirely arm’s length arrangement. For example, displacement of fiduciary duties is effective only to the extent that the displacement is stated clearly and with particularity. This rule is fundamental in the jurisprudence of fiduciary duty.
       <i>
        See, e.g., Paige Capital Mgmt., LLC v. Lerner Master Fund, LLC
       </i>
       , Civ. A. No. 5502–CS, 2011 WL 3505355 at *31 (Del. Ch. Aug. 8 2011) (stating that, even under a statute that “permits the waiver of fiduciary duties … such waivers must be set forth clearly”);
       <i>
        Kelly v. Blum
       </i>
       , Civ. A. No. 4516-VCP, 2010 WL 629850, at *10 n.70 (Del. Ch. Feb. 24, 2010) (“Having been granted great contractual freedom by the LLC Act, drafters of or parties to an LLC agreement should be expected to provide … clear and unambiguous provisions when they desire to expand, restrict or eliminate the operation of traditional fiduciary duties”). It would therefore be manifestly unreasonable for a partnership agreement to negate this rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although Subsection (d)(2) does not expressly address contracts between a limited partnership and general partner, the stated constraints must also apply to such contracts. If not, those constraints are effectively meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A limited partnership enters into a management contract with its sole general partner, and the contract provides that the duties of loyalty stated in Section 409(b) are entirely eliminated. If the partnership agreement were to so provide, the provision would be subject to the “manifestly unreasonable standard.” Section 105(d)(2)(A). Absent the authorization provided by Section 105(d)(2)(A), the management contract’s attempt to waive fiduciary duties may be unenforceable as a matter of public policy and contract law.
       See Neubauer v. Goldfarb
    , 108 Cal. App. 4th 47, 57, 133 Cal. Rptr. 2d 218 (2003) (stating that “waiver of corporate directors' and majority shareholders' fiduciary duties to minority shareholders in private close corporations is against public policy and a contract provision in a buy-sell agreement purporting to effect such a waiver is void”). If not, a court should hold the provision unenforceable nonetheless so as to avoid eviscerating Subsection (d)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)(2)(A)
       </b>
       – Subject to the “not manifestly unreasonable” standard, this paragraph empowers the partnership agreement to eliminate
       all
    aspects of the duty of loyalty listed in Section 409(b). The obligation of good faith and fair dealing, Section 409(d), would remain.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Subsection (c)(6). As to any other, uncodified aspects of the duty of loyalty, see Subsection (d)(2)(D) (empowering the partnership agreement to “alter or eliminate any other fiduciary duty”).
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Joint Venture Limited Partnership (“JV”) is a limited partnership, with two general partners, Kappa, Inc. (“Kappa”) and Lambda, LLC (“Lambda”). The partnership agreement provides that:
      </p>
      <p>
       • JV is managed by a “board” consisting of one person appointed by Kappa and one person appointed by Lambda;
      </p>
      <p>
       • each appointee:
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       owes fiduciary and any other duties exclusively to the general partner that made the appointment; and
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       owes no duties to:
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       the other general partner;
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       the limited partners; and
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       the limited partnership itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The “not manifestly unreasonable” standard applies to these provisions under Subsection (d)(2)(A) and (D), and the provisions are not manifestly unreasonable. Note that the provisions do not affect the duties of Kappa and Lambda as general partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: ABC Limited Partnership (“ABC”) is a limited partnership with three general partners. ABC has two entirely separate lines of business, the Alpha business and the Beta business. Under ABC’s partnership agreement:
      </p>
      <p>
       • General Partner 1’s responsibilities pertain exclusively to the Alpha business, while responsibility for:
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       the Beta business is allocated exclusively to General Partner 2; and
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       ABC’s overall operations is allocated exclusively to General Partner 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       • General Partner 2’s responsibilities pertain exclusively to the Beta business, while responsibility for:
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR

       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       ABC’s overall operations is allocated exclusively to General Partner 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       • General Partner 1 has no fiduciary duties pertaining to the Beta business.
      </p>
      <p>
       • General Partner 2 has no fiduciary duties pertaining to the Alpha business.
      </p>
      <p>
       The “not manifestly unreasonable” standard applies to these provisions under Subsection (d)(2)(A) and (D), and the provisions are not manifestly unreasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)(2)(B)
       </b>
       – Under this paragraph, a partnership agreement might provide that an affiliate of a general partner will provide compensated services to the limited partnership at a price not exceeding market price, or that a general partner may pursue opportunities that otherwise would be partnership opportunities. Such arrangements are commonplace and permissible.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)(2)(C)
       </b>
       – In this context, “conduct” includes both acts and omissions. Black's Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009), conduct (defining conduct as “[p]ersonal behavior, whether by action or inaction”). Subject to the “not manifestly unreasonable” standard and the bedrock requirements stated here and in Subsection (c)(8), the partnership agreement can reduce the duty of care substantially. In particular, the partnership agreement can eliminate the aspects of the duty of care pertaining to gross negligence and recklessness.
      </p>
      <p>
       This provision replicates in a particular context the general rule stated in Subsection (c)(8). For the meaning of “bad faith” in the context of the duty of care, see Subsection (c)(8), comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       – The “not manifestly unreasonable” concept became part of uniform business entity statutes when UPA (1997) imported the concept from the Uniform Commercial Code. (In the current version of the Uniform Commercial Code, the concept appears in Section 1-302(b).)
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection provides rules for applying the concept, specifying:
      </p>
      <p>
       • who decides the issue of “manifestly unreasonable”
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       “the court … as a matter of law,” Subsection (e);
      </p>
      <p>
       • the framework for determining the issue
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       determination to be made “in light of the purposes, activities, and affairs of the limited partnership,” Subsection (e)(2);
      </p>
      <p>
       • the temporal setting for determining the issue
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       “determination [to be made] as of the time the challenged term became part of the partnership agreement,” Subsection (e)(1); and
      </p>
      <p>
       • what information is admissible for determining the issue
      </p>
      <p>
       UNHANDLEDCHAR
       “only circumstances existing” when “the challenged term became part of the partnership agreement,” Subsection (e)(1).
      </p>
      <p>
       The subsection also provides a very demanding standard for persons claiming that a term of a partnership agreement is “manifestly unreasonable.” “The court … may invalidate the term only if, in light of the purposes, activities, and affairs of the limited partnership it is
       readily apparent
    that: (A) the objective of the term is unreasonable; or (B) the term is an unreasonable means to achieve the term’s objective.” Subsection (e)(2) (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (e) is fundamental to this act, because: (i) this act generally defers to the agreement among the partners; and (ii) Subsection (e) safeguards the partnership agreement in at least four ways:
      </p>
      <p>
       • Determining manifest unreasonableness
       inter se
    partners of an organization is a different task than doing so in a commercial context, where concepts like “usages of trade” are available to inform the analysis. Each business organization must be understood in its own terms and context.
      </p>
      <p>
       • If loosely applied, the concept of “manifestly unreasonable” would permit a court to rewrite the partners’ agreement, which would destroy the balance this act seeks to establish between freedom of contract and fiduciary duty.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Case law has not adequately delineated the concept.
       See, e.g., In re Brobeck, Phleger &amp; Harrison LLP
    , 408 B.R. 318, 335 (Bankr. N.D. Cal. 2009) (“RUPA [UPA (1997)] does not define what is ‘manifestly unreasonable’ and the parties have not cited, nor can the court locate, a decision that defines the term. Absent case law or even a dictionary definition, the court must rely on its common sense to recognize something as manifestly unreasonable.”).
      </p>
      <p>
       • In the context of statutes permitting stock transfer restrictions unless “manifestly unreasonable,” courts have often ignored the word “manifestly.”
       See, e.g., Brandt v. Somerville
    , 692 N.W.2d 144, 152 (N.D. 2005) (stating that “in close corporations, a majority of courts have sustained restrictions that are determined to be reasonable in light of the relevant circumstances”);
       <i>
        Roof Depot, Inc. v. Ohman
       </i>
       , 638 N.W.2d 782, 786 (Minn. Ct. App. 2002) (stating that “the restrictions [on share transfer] are not ‘manifestly 44 unreasonable’ because they are reasonable means to ensure that the management and control of the business remains in the group of investors or with people well known to them”);
       <i>
        Castriota v. Castriota
       </i>
       , 268 N.J. Super. 417, 423-24, 633 A.2d 1024, 1027-28 (App. Div. 1993) (“We are obliged to apply the statute in a manner consonant with its essential purpose to permit reasonable restrictions upon alienation.”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)(1)
       </b>
       – The significance of the phrase “as of the time the term as challenged became part of the partnership agreement” is best shown by example.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: When a particular limited partnership comes into existence, its business plan is quite unusual and its success depends on the willingness of a particular individual to serve as the limited partnership’s sole general partner. This individual has a rare combination of skills, experiences, and contacts, which are particularly appropriate for the partnership’s start-up. In order to induce the individual to accept the position of sole general partner, the other partners are willing to have the partnership agreement significantly limit the general partner’s fiduciary duties. Several years later, when the limited partnership’s operations have turned prosaic and the general partner’s talents and background are not nearly so crucial, a limited partner challenges the fiduciary duty limitations as manifestly unreasonable. The relevant time under Subsection (e)(1) is when the limited partnership began. Subsequent developments are not relevant, except as they might inferentially bear on the circumstances in existence at the relevant time.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: As initially adopted, a partnership agreement identifies a category of decisions ordinarily subject to the duty of loyalty and provides that “the general partner’s sole, reasonable discretion” satisfies the duty. A year later, the agreement is amended to delete the word “reasonable.” Later, a partner claims that, without the word “reasonable,” the provision is manifestly unreasonable. The relevant time under Subsection (e)(1) is when the agreement was amended, not when the agreement was initially adopted.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)(2)
       </b>
       – If a person claims that a term of the partnership agreement is manifestly unreasonable under Subsections (c)(7) or (d)(2), as a matter of ordinary procedural law the person making the claim has the burden of proof.

        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – This subsection resolves twin questions that have troubled some courts – namely, whether an unincorporated entity that has not signed its foundational agreement nonetheless is bound by and may enforce the agreement. The questions have been particularly troubling in the context of agreements to arbitrate.
       See, e.g., Elkjer v. Scheef &amp; Stone, L.L.P
    ., 3:13-CV-1655-K, --- F. Supp. 2d ----,
       2014 WL 1255844 at *5-6 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 27, 2014) (concluding that a limited liability partnership “is a party to the Partnership Agreement,” even though the partnership itself never signed or otherwise assented to the agreement; enforcing arbitration provision to the benefit of the
       LLP).
       <i>
        Contra Trover v. 419 OCR, Inc.
       </i>
       , 397 Ill. App. 3d 403, 409, 921 N.E.2d 1249, 1255 (2010) (finding that “neither FODG [an LLC] nor the Golf Club [a related LLC] was a party to the operating agreements and that they are therefore not bound by the arbitration clauses therein”).
      </p>
      <p>
       Developments pertaining to the Virginia LLC Act further illustrate the difficulties.
       In
       Mission Residential, LLC v. Triple Net Properties, LLC
    , 275 Va. 157, 161-62, 654 S.E.2d 888, 891 (2008), the Virginia Supreme Court held that an LLC member’s derivative claim was not subject to the arbitration provision in the operating agreement, because: (i) the LLC was “the real party in interest;” (ii) the LLC had not signed the operating agreement; and (iii) requiring the claim to be arbitrated would “ignore[] the separate existence of Holdings [the LLC].” The Virginia legislature promptly disagreed and amended the LLC act to state: “A limited liability company is bound by its operating agreement whether or not the limited liability company executes the operating agreement.”
       Va. Code Ann. § 13.1–1023.A.1 (2012). The legislature left open the question of a limited liability company’s power to enforce an operating agreement that the company has not executed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection answers the twin questions, categorically and in the affirmative.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection does not consider whether a limited partnership is an indispensable party to a suit concerning the partnership agreement. That is a question of procedural law, and the answer can determine whether federal diversity jurisdiction exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – Given the possibility of oral and implied-in-fact terms in the partnership agreement, a person becoming a partner of an existing limited partnership should take precautions to ascertain fully the contents of the partnership agreement.

        Subsection (c)

        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – This subsection, derived from
       Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, § 18-302(e), permits the partnership agreement to: (i) accord a non-partner veto rights over amendments to the agreement; and (ii) establish other preconditions for amendments. An amendment made in derogation of a veto right or precondition is ineffective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Veto rights are likely to be sought by lenders but may also be attractive to non-partner managers.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A non-partner manager enters into a management contract with a limited partnership, and that agreement provides in part that the limited partnership may remove the manager without cause only with the consent of partners holding 2/3 of the profits interests. The partnership agreement contains a parallel provision (the “partnership agreement’s quantum provision”), but the non-partner manager is not a party to the partnership agreement. Later, the partners amend the partnership agreement’s quantum provision to reduce the quantum to a simple majority of profits interests and thereafter purport to remove the manager without cause. Although the limited partnership has undoubtedly breached its contract with the manager and subjected itself to a damage claim, the limited partnership has the
       power
    under Section 105(a)(2) to effect the removal – unless the partnership agreement provides the manager a veto right over changes in the partnership agreement‘s quantum provision.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection does not refer to partner veto rights because, unless otherwise provided in the partnership agreement, the consent of each partner is necessary to effect an amendment.
       See
    Section 406(b)(1). Because “[a] partnership agreement may specify that its amendment requires … the satisfaction of a condition,” a partnership agreement can require that any amendment be made through a writing or a record signed by each partner.
       <i>
        See also
       </i>
       Section 105(a)(3) (empowering the partnership agreement to determine “the means and conditions for amending the partnership agreement”).

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – The law of unincorporated business organizations is only beginning to grapple in a modern way with the tension between the rights of an organization’s owners to carry on their activities as they see fit (or have agreed) and the rights of transferees of the organization’s economic interests. Such transferees can include the heirs of business founders as well as former owners who are “locked in” as transferees of their own interests.
       See
    Section 602(a)(3) and 605(a)(4).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the law categorically favors the owners, there is a serious risk of expropriation and other abuse. On the other hand, if the law grants former owners and other transferees the right to seek judicial protection, that specter can “freeze the deal” as of the moment an owner leaves the enterprise or a third party obtains an economic interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scant case law in this area clearly favors the remaining partners over former partners and other transferees.
       See, e.g., Bauer v. Blomfield Co./Holden Joint Venture
    , 849 P2d 1365, 1367 n.2 (Alaska 1993) (holding that a mere assignee “was not entitled to complain about a decision made with the consent of all the partners” and stating “[w]e are unwilling to hold that partners owe a duty of good faith and fair dealing to assignees of a partner's interest”);
       <i>
        Bynum v. Frisby
       </i>
       , 73 Nev. 145, 149-50, 311 P.2d 972, 975 (1957) (“[A]n assignment of a partnership interest from one partner to a stranger does not bring that stranger into fiduciary relationship with the remaining partners nor require them to resort to dissolution in order to prevent such a relationship from arising. The stranger remains a stranger entitled only to share in the partnership's worth and to demand an accounting upon dissolution.”) (applying UPA (1914) § 27, pertaining to rights of an assignee).

      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection follows
       Bauer
    and other cases by expressly subjecting transferees (including a person dissociated as a partner) to partnership agreement amendments made after the transfer or dissociation, except amendments that increase obligations on transferees. For example, an amendment might extend the duration of a limited partnership but may not institute a new capital call obligation on transferees.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question of whether, in extreme and sufficiently harsh circumstances, transferees might be able to claim some type of duty or obligation to protect against expropriation awaits development in the case law. An unreported LLC case suggests the answer might be yes, but the decision rests primarily on the wording of the LLC’s operating agreement.
       In
       Kohannim v. Katoli
    , 08-11-00155-CV, 2013 WL 3943078 at *10-11 (Tex. App. July 24, 2013), the court: (i) noted an LLC’s “Regulations provide[] for the distribution of ‘available cash’ to members quarterly provided that the available cash is not needed for a reasonable working capital reserve”; (ii) noted that “Jacob [the defendant member] paid himself $100,000 for management services that were not performed and failed to make any profit distributions to Mike [former member and ex-spouse of the plaintiff Parvaneh] or Parvaneh [ex-spouse of Mike, who became Mike’s transferee as part of their divorce proceeding] even though more than $250,000 in undistributed profit had accumulated in the company's accounts since the mortgage on the property had been paid off in February 2007”; and (iii) concluded that “more than a scintilla of evidence supports the trial court's finding that Jacob failed to make profit distributions to Parvaneh.” In essence, the court upheld a finding that Jacob had breached (or caused the LLC to breach) a contractual obligation to make distributions. But the court went further: “We also agree with the trial court's conclusion that the established facts demonstrated Jacob engaged in wrongful conduct and exhibited a lack of fair dealing in the company's affairs to the prejudice of Parvaneh.”

       For the very limited rights of transferees, see Section 702.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)
       </b>
       – This provision is inapposite when “a partner or transferee becomes entitled to receive a distribution.” Section 503(d). In that circumstance:
      </p>
      <p>
       • “the partner or transferee has the status of … a creditor of the limited partnership with respect to the distribution,”
       Id.
    ; and
      </p>
      <p>
       • the relevant obligation is not owed to “a person in the person’s capacity as a transferee or person dissociated as a partner,” Subsection (b), but rather to the person in the person’s capacity as a creditor.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       – This provision precludes using the certificate of limited partnership to make an end run around the strictures of Section 105(c) and (d)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       – It will be possible, albeit improvident, for a limited partnership agreement to be inconsistent with the certificate of limited partnership or other public filings pertaining to the partnership. For those circumstances, this subsection provides rules for determining which source of information prevails:
      </p>
      <p>
       • For partners, persons dissociated as partners, and transferees, the partnership agreement is paramount.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Third parties may invoke the public record upon a showing of reasonable reliance, which presupposes actual knowledge –
       i.e.
    , deemed knowledge under Section 103(d) does not suffice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact that a term is present in a publicly-filed record and not in the partnership agreement, or
       vice versa
    , does not automatically establish a conflict. This subsection does not expressly cover a situation in which: (i) one of the specified filed records contains information in addition to, but not inconsistent with, the partnership agreement; and (ii) a person, other than a partner or transferee, reasonably relies on the additional information. However, the policy reflected in this subsection seems equally applicable to that situation. Moreover, to argue that the partnership agreement prevails over the filed record is to argue that the additional term does conflict with the partnership agreement, at least in effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 105(a)(3) might also be relevant to the subject matter of this subsection. Absent a contrary provision in the partnership agreement, language in a certificate of limited partnership or other record delivered to the filing office for filing on behalf of the limited partnership might be evidence of the partners’ agreement and thereby constitute or at least imply a term of the partnership agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection does not apply to records delivered to the filing office for filing on behalf of a person other than a limited partnership.

      <p>
       A required information section first appeared in ULPA (1976) § 105, although the notion of information rights traces back to the original uniform limited partnership act, ULPA (1916) § 10.
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement cannot vary this section. However, subject to Section 105(c)(9), the agreement can vary Sections 304 and 407, which govern access to and use of the information required by this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (5)
       </b>
       – This requirement applies to both superseded and current agreements and amendments. An agreement or amendment is “made in a record” to the extent the agreement is integrated into a record and consented to in that memorialized form. It is possible for a partnership agreement to be made in part in a record and in part otherwise.
       See
    Section 102(14), cmt. An oral agreement that is subsequently inscribed in a record (but not consented to as such) was not “made in a record” and is not covered by this paragraph. However, if the limited partnership happens to have such a record, Section 304(b) might and Section 407(a)(2) will provide a right of access.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (8)
       </b>
       – This paragraph does not require a limited partnership to make a record of consents given and votes taken. However, if the limited partnership has made such a record, this paragraph requires that the limited partnership maintain the record for three years. The requirement applies to any record made by the limited partnership, not just to records made contemporaneously with the giving of consent or voting. The three-year period runs from when the record was made and not from when the consent was given or vote taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (9)
       </b>
       – Information is “contained in a partnership agreement made in a record” only to the extent that the information is integrated into a record and, in that memorialized form, has been consented to as part of the partnership agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       This paragraph is not a statute of frauds provision. For example, failure to comply with Paragraph (9)(A) or (B) does not render unenforceable an oral promise to make a contribution. Likewise, failure to comply with Paragraph (9)(D) does not invalidate an oral term of the partnership specifying “events upon the happening of which the limited partnership is to be dissolved and its activities wound up.”
       See also
    Section 801(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversely, the mere fact that a limited partnership maintains a record in purported compliance with Paragraph (9)(A) or (B) does not prove that a person has actually promised to make a contribution. Likewise, the mere fact that a limited partnership maintains a record in purported compliance with Paragraph (9)(D) does not prove that the partnership agreement actually includes the specified events as causes of dissolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consistent with the partnership agreement’s plenary power to structure and regulate the relations of the partners
       inter se
    , a partnership agreement can impose “made in a record” requirements which render unenforceable oral promises to make contributions or oral understandings as to “events upon the happening of which the limited partnership is to be dissolved.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (9)(A) and (B)
       </b>
       – Often a partnership agreement will state in record form the value of contributions made and promised to be made. If not, these provisions require that the value be stated in a record maintained as part of the limited partnership’s required information. This act does not authorize the limited partnership or the general partners to set the value of a contribution without the concurrence of the person who has made or promised the contribution, although the partnership agreement itself can grant that authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (9)(C)
       </b>
       – The information required by this provision is essential for determining what happens to the transferable interests of a person that is both a general partner and a limited partner and that dissociates in one of those capacities but not the other.
       See
    Sections 602(a)(3) and 605(a)(5).

       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – The “separate entity” characteristic is fundamental to a limited partnership and is inextricably connected to both the liability shield, Sections 303 and 404(b), and the inability of creditors of a partner or transferee to reach the assets of the limited partnership, absent a “reverse pierce” or a claim of fraudulent transfer.
       See, e.g., C.F. Trust, Inc. v. First Flight, L.P.
    , 580 S.E.2d 806, 810 (Va. 2003) (“hold[ing] that Virginia does recognize the concept of outsider reverse piercing and that this concept can be applied to a Virginia limited partnership”);
       <i>
        In re Flanagan
       </i>
       , 373 B.R. 216, 223, n.6 (Bankr. D. Conn. 2007) (stating that “[r]everse piercing claims have been recognized as viable causes of action in Connecticut” and “[t]he fact that [an entity] is a limited partnership does not alter the analysis”);
       <i>
        Egle v. Egle
       </i>
       , 817 So. 2d 136, 140 (La. Ct. App. 2002) (allowing plaintiff to proceed with claims that transfers made by her ex-spouse inter alia to an LLC were sham transactions).
      </p>
      <p>
       Acquiring or relinquishing an LLLP shield changes only the rules governing a general partner’s liability for subsequently incurred obligations of the limited partnership. The underlying entity is unaffected.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – Although some limited partnership statutes continue to require a business purpose, this act follows the current trend and takes a more expansive approach. The phrase “any lawful purpose, regardless of whether for profit” encompasses even charitable activities, but this act does not include any comprehensive protections pertaining to charitable assets and purposes. Section 1104(b) does contain a “nondiversion” provision, but the provision applies only to the organic transactions contemplated by Article 11. Comprehensive protections must be (and typically are) found in other law, although sometimes that “other law” appears within a state’s non-profit corporation statute.
       See, e.g.
    ,
       Minn. Stat. § 317A.811 (2012) (providing restrictions on charitable organizations that seek to “dissolve, merge, or consolidate, or to transfer all or substantially all of their assets” but imposing those restrictions only on “corporations,” which are elsewhere defined as corporations incorporated under the non-profit corporation act).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       – The word “perpetual” is a misnomer, albeit one commonplace in limited partnership and limited liability company statutes. In this context, “perpetual” means merely that the act: (i) does not require a definite term; and (ii) creates no immediate nexus between the dissociation of a partner and the dissolution of the entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, the public record pertaining to a limited partnership will not necessarily reveal whether the limited partnership actually has a perpetual duration or has in fact dissolved, because: (i) this act, like all limited partnership statutes, provides several consent-based methods to dissolve a limited partnership; and (ii) none of those methods involve a public filing. For example, dissolution and winding up of a limited partnership may result from a term specified in the partnership agreement, an event specified in the partnership agreement, or the affirmative vote or consent of all partners.
       See
    Sections 801 (events causing dissolution) and 802 (winding up required upon dissolution). A partnership agreement is not a publicly-filed document, and a partner vote to dissolve a limited partnership is not a public event. A dissolved limited partnership may deliver to the filing office for filing an amendment to the certificate of limited partnership stating that the partnership is dissolved, Section 802(b)(2)(A), and later a statement of termination, Section 802(b)(2)(F), or both, but the filing of such statements is permissive rather than mandatory.
       <i>
        Id.
       </i>
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, the public record will not reveal when (or even whether) a limited partnership has come into existence.
       See
    Section 201(d) (providing that the formation of a limited partnership requires both that the certificate of limited partnership become effective and that at least two separate persons become partners, with at least one being a general partner and one being a limited partner).

      <p>
       Continuing the approach initiated in ULPA (2001) § 105, this act omits as unnecessary any detailed list of specific powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement cannot vary a limited partnership’s capacity to sue and be sued. Section 105(c)(2). A limited partnership’s standing to enforce the partnership agreement is a separate matter, which is covered by Section 106(a) (stating, as a default rule, that the limited partnership “may enforce the partnership agreement”).

       This section does not provide for the renewal of a name reservation for successive 120 day periods. A new reservation may be filed upon the expiration of a reservation, but by requiring a new filing this section creates the possibility that another party may timely submit a reservation for the same name. It was considered appropriate to allow for that possibility so that the procedure in this section cannot be used to block a name indefinitely.

       Unlike the reservation of a name under Section 115, a registration of a name under this section may be renewed for successive periods thus permitting a name to be protected for a period longer than the initial registration period. Use of the procedure in this section is limited, however, to the names of foreign limited partnerships which are not registered to do business in the state. The purpose of this section is to permit a foreign entity to make sure its name will be available if it chooses to register in the state in the future.

       A change in the identity of the registered agent of a limited partnership or foreign limited partnership or a change of the office address of a partnership’s registered agent are usually routine matters that do not affect the rights of the partners of the represented limited partnership. This section permits those changes to be made without: (i) amendment of the certificate of limited partnership; (ii) formal approval by the general partners; and (iii) any approval by the limited partners. For the registered agent’s power to resign, see Section 119. For the registered agent’s power to change its name, address, or both, see Section 120.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>

       Resignation under this section may be accomplished solely by action of the registered agent and does not require the cooperation or consent of the represented limited partnership or registered foreign limited partnership. Whether a resignation violates a contract between the registered agent and the partnership is beyond the scope of this act, and Subsection (d) preserves whatever claims a represented partnership may have against its registered agent for a wrongful termination. Even if a resignation were to violate such a contract, the resignation would still be effective if the provisions of this section were followed.

       This section permits a registered agent to change the name and address of the agent that appears in the registered agent filing of a limited partnership or foreign limited partnership represented by the agent. This act does not provide for commercial registered agents.
    Cf.
    UBOC (2011) (Last Amended 2013) §§ 1-405, 1-406, 1-409. As a result, a registered agent will need to make a separate filing under this section for each limited partnership and foreign limited partnership represented by the agent, unless, if authorized by rule or administrative policy, the filing office establishes procedures for a bulk filing with one filing listing the names of all the registered agent’s represented entities.

        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – This subsection offers three alternative methods for establishing the date service is effected, a date important for determining the time within which a limited partnership or registered foreign limited partnership must respond to the process, notice, or demand served. Under Subsection (b)(1), service is effected on the date or receipt by the partnership of the mail or commercial delivery. Under Subsection (b)(2), service is effected on the date shown on the return receipt, if signed on behalf of the partnership. Under Subsection (b)(3), service is effected five days after it is deposited with the Postal Service or with a similar commercial delivery service, if correctly addressed and with correct postage or payment. Service is effective at the earliest of the three listed circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, for the party effecting service there are difficulties of proof under the first two circumstances. Under Subsection (b)(1) the exact date of the receipt by the limited partnership or registered foreign limited partnership of mail or commercial delivery is peculiarly within the knowledge of the limited partnership. Under Subsection (b)(2) the return receipt must be signed on behalf of the partnership. That requirement is designed to assure that the service is actually received by the partnership, but the signature on the return receipt may not always show unambiguously that the signer was acting for the partnership and was authorized to do so. As a practical matter, therefore, parties effecting service under Subsection (b) may find it most convenient to rely on Subsection (c) and to maintain their own records so that the date of deposit in the mails or with a commercial delivery service can easily be established.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       – This subsection provides a means for serving process on a limited partnership or foreign limited partnership that cannot be served under Subsection (a) or (b). Some limited partnership statutes require or permit service of process in that circumstance be made on the filing office.

      <p>
       Provisions similar to this section have their genesis in
       Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward
    , 17 U.S. (4 Wheat) 518 (1819), which held that the United States Constitution prohibited the application of newly enacted statutes to existing corporations while suggesting the efficacy of a reservation of power similar to this section. This section is a generalized form of the type of provision found in many entity organic laws, the purpose of which is to avoid any possible argument that an entity has contractual or vested rights in any specific statutory provision of its organic law and to ensure that the state may in the future modify its entity statutes as it deems appropriate and require existing entities to comply with the statutes as modified.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section applies to changes in mandatory provisions of this act; the section does not pertain to changes in default rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Having enacted this act, State A later amends Section 401(b)(3) (affirmative vote or consent of all partners required for a person to become a general partner) to reduce, as a default rule, the necessary quantum of consent to consent from partners owning in the aggregate at least two-third of the interests in current profits owned by partners at the time of the consent. XYZ, LP is a limited partnership formed under State A’s act before the amendment. XYZ’s partnership agreement is silent on this issue, leaving in place the act’s default rule. Whether the act’s amended default rule applies depends on whether the partners initially: (i) agreed (whether expressly or implicitly) to accept the then-applicable default rule requiring unanimous consent; (ii) agreed (whether expressly or implicitly) to adopt whatever rule the act provided; or (iii) never considered the issue. In short, the change in a default rule occasions an inquiry into the partners’ express or implied agreement as to the role of the default rule in their mutual understanding. In the first instance, the old rule would continue in effect. In the second and third instances, the new rule would apply.

      </h4>
      <p>
       For a limited partnership to be formed (
    i.e
    ., to come into existence), four conditions must be met: (i) a certificate of limited partnership must become effective; (ii) at least two persons must become a partners; (iii) at least one person must become a general partner; and (iv) at least one person must become a limited partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       By definition, the earliest a person can become a limited partner is when the certificate of limited partnership takes effect.
    See
    Section 102(11) (defining “limited partner” as a person that “has become a limited partner under Section 301”). However, a certificate of limited partnership can take effect long before any person becomes a limited partner, and the act does not require any public filing to indicate that a person has become a limited partner. Therefore, the public record will not reflect when (and even whether) a limited partnership has come into existence.

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)

       – Consistent with the modern trend, this act requires only the most “bare bones” of disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(4)
       </b>
       – The requirement to identify all general partners dates back to 1916. ULPA (1916) § 2. When a person dissociates as a general partner or a person becomes a new general partner, the certificate must be amended.
    See
    Section 202(d). However, a person can become a general partner for many purposes without being listed as such on the certificate.

        Section (b)(5)
       </b>
       – This act permits a limited partnership to be a limited liability limited partnership (“LLLP”), and this provision requires the certificate of limited partnership to state whether the limited partnership is an LLLP. The requirement is intended to force the organizers of a limited partnership to decide whether the limited partnership is to be an LLLP.

       Subject to Sections 406(b)(2) and 105(c)(5), a limited partnership may amend its certificate of limited partnership to add or delete a statement that the limited partnership is a limited liability limited partnership. An amendment deleting such a statement must be accompanied by an amendment stating that the limited partnership is
    not
    a limited liability limited partnership. Section 201(b)(5) does not permit a certificate of limited partnership to be silent on this point, except for pre-existing partnerships that become subject to this act under Section 112.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 112(c)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       – This provision permits the certificate of limited partnership to contain information beyond that required in Subsection (b). A limited partnership should have good reason, however, before choosing to include additional information. Such information: (i) is available to the public (including competitors); (ii) increases the chances of a conflict between the certificate of limited partnership and the partnership agreement,
    see
    Section 107(d); (iii) permits the argument that the additional information is part of the partnership agreement,
       <i>
        see
       </i>
       Section 102(14), cmt. (stating that “[t]he partnership agreement may comprise a number of separate documents (or records), however denominated, unless the partnership agreement itself provides otherwise”); and (iv) can be confusing to the extent the information appears to delineate the power of persons to act for the limited partnership. In any event, placing additional information in the certificate of limited partnership does not enable a limited partnership to “end run” the provisions of Section 105(c) and (d) (limiting the power of the partnership agreement to vary specified provisions of this act).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Like other provisions of the act requiring records to be delivered to the filing officer for filing, this section is not subject to change by the partnership agreement.
       See
    Section 105(c)(3). Except for Subsection (d), this section is essentially mechanical.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       – This subsection lists changes in circumstances which require an amendment to the certificate. Neither a statement of change, Section 118, nor the annual/biennial report, Section 212, suffice to report the addition or deletion of a general partner or the appointment of a person to wind up a limited partnership that has no general partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acquiring or relinquishing LLLP status also requires an amendment to the certificate.
       See
    Sections 105(c)(5), 201(b)(5), 406(b)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection states an obligation of the limited partnership. However, so long as the limited partnership has at least one general partner, the general partner or partners are responsible for managing the limited partnership’s activities. Section 406(a). That management responsibility includes maintaining accuracy in the limited partnership’s public record. Moreover, Subsection (e) imposes direct responsibility on any general partner that knows that the filed certificate of limited partnership contains false information.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       – This subsection imposes an obligation directly on the general partners rather than on the limited partnership. A general partner’s failure to meet the obligation can expose the general partner to liability to third parties under Section 205(a)(2) and might constitute a breach of the general partner’s duties under Section 409(c). In addition, an
       aggrieved person may seek a remedy under Sections 204 (Signing and Filing Pursuant to Judicial
       Order) and 205 (Liability for Inaccurate Information in Filed Record).

        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – This subsection relates to liability to third parties for inaccurate information in a filed record. Paragraph 1 requires actual knowledge because the paragraph can inculpate a person who is not a general partner. Under Paragraph 2(B), notice suffices, because: (i) the provision applies only to general partners; (ii) by status these persons have overall management authority; and (iii) therefore it is reasonable to impose liability when a person either knows or “has reason to know … from all the facts known to the person at the time in question.” Section 103(b)(1) (defining notice). For the same reason, Paragraph 1 applies only to “information [known] to be inaccurate at the time the record was signed,” while Paragraph 2 applies whenever a “general partner knew or had notice of the inaccuracy for a reasonably sufficient time before the information was relied upon so that, before the reliance, the general partner reasonably could have [taken corrective action].” Paragraph (2)(B).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       – Although this act establishes the avoidance of gross negligence as the standard of care for general partners viz-a-viz the limited partnership, this provision encompasses liability to third parties. Accordingly, the standard here is more demanding. The phrases “reasonably sufficient time” and “reasonably could have” indicate a standard of ordinary care. “[N]otice of the inaccuracy” involves “reason to know.” Section 103(b)(1)
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – This subsection provides criminal liability. The elements of perjury are a matter for the criminal law of the jurisdiction of formation.

      <p>
       The filing office’s duty under this section is ministerial, Section 210(a), and the office’s
       assessment of a record delivered for filing is limited to conformity with this section. The filing
       office
    must
    file a record delivered for filing if the record contains the information required by
       this act and is accompanied by the required filing fee. The filing office is authorized to provide
       forms but not require their use, and, as a result, may not reject records delivered for filing on the
       basis of form (except to the very limited extent permitted by Subsections (d) and (f)).
      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the very limited discretion granted to the filing office under this section and Section 210(a), “[t]he filing of … a record does not create a presumption that the information contained in the record is correct….” Section 210(e).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – The first requisite for having a record filed is to cause the record actually to be received by the filing office. Section 122(b) reiterates this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       – A record delivered for filing must be in typewritten or printed form unless the filing office permits delivery by electronic transmission. The types of electronic transmission that may be used will be determined by the filing office and is intended to include the evolving methods of electronic delivery, including facsimile transmissions, electronic transmissions between computers and filings through delivery of storage media.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(3)
       </b>
       – The text of an entity filing must be in the English language, except to the limited extent permitted by this paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(4)
       </b>
       – To be filed a record must be signed by the appropriate person. For a description of the manner in which a record may be “signed,” see Section 102(22) (defining “sign”). Who is an appropriate person is determined under Section 203, but the filing office will not check to determine whether a person purportedly authorized to sign is in fact authorized.
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement in some state statutes that records delivered for filing on behalf of an entity must be acknowledged or verified as a condition for filing has been rejected. These requirements serve little purpose in connection with entity filings. On the other hand, many organizations, like lenders or title companies, may desire that specific records include acknowledgements, verifications, or seals; Subsection (a)(4) does not prohibit the addition of these forms of execution and their use does not affect the eligibility of the record for filing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – Under this subsection, a confidentiality obligation does not affect the filing office’s duty to file, and the filing office is authorized but not required to redact. This act does not affect any confidentiality-related obligations the filing office may have under other law.

      <p>
       Records accepted for filing become effective at the date and time of filing as recorded by the filing office, or at another specified time on that date, unless a permissible delayed effective date is stated in the record.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 210(b) requires the filing office to maintain some means of recording the date and time of delivery of a record and requires that office to record that date and time as the date and time of filing. That provision gives express statutory authority to the common practice of most filing offices of ignoring processing time and treating a record as filed as of the date and time it is delivered for filing even though it may not be reviewed and accepted for filing until several days after delivery. That section contemplates that time of delivery, as well as the date, will be routinely recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (1)
       </b>
       – In the absence of provision for a delayed effective date, a record delivered for filing becomes effective on the date and time of filing by the filing office. Since under 210(b) the date and time of filing is the recorded date and time of delivery of the record to the filing office (which under Section 210(b) is the date and time of actual receipt), together these provisions eliminate any doubt about situations involving same-day transactions in which a record, for example, a statement of merger, is delivered for filing on the morning of the day the merger is to become effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (3)
       </b>
       – This paragraph does not authorize or contemplate the retroactive establishment of an effective date before the date of filing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraphs (3) and (4)
       </b>
       – A record that states an effective date beyond the 90-day limit is not a record that “satisfies this [act],” Section 210(a), and will properly be rejected by the filing office.

       This section permits making corrections in filed records without re-submitting the entire record.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(1) and (2)
       </b>
       – A filed record may be corrected because it contains an inaccuracy or because it was defectively executed (including defects in optional forms of execution that do not affect the eligibility of the original record for filing).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(3)
       </b>
       – In addition, a filed record may be corrected if its electronic transmission was defective –
    i.e
    ., where an electronic delivery is made but, due to a defect in transmission, the filed record is later discovered to be inconsistent with the record intended to be filed. If no delivery is made because of a defect in transmission, a statement of correction may not be used to effect a retroactive filing. Therefore, a limited partnership making an electronic delivery should take steps to confirm that the transmission was received by the filing office.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       – A provision in a filed record setting an effective date may be corrected under this section, but the corrected effective date must comply with Section 207, which limits delayed effective dates to within ninety days after filing. A corrected effective date is thus measured from the date of the original filing of the record being corrected,
    i.e
    ., it cannot be before the date of filing of the record or more than ninety days thereafter.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       – The correction relates back to the original effective date of the record being corrected, except as to persons relying on the original entity filing and adversely affected by the correction. As to these persons, the effective date of the statement of correction is the date the statement is filed.

       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – Under this subsection the filing office is required to file a record if it “satisfies this [act].” The purpose of this language is to limit the discretion of the filing office to a ministerial role in reviewing the contents of records. If the record submitted is in the form prescribed, contains the information required by this act, and the appropriate filing fee is tendered, the filing office must file the record. Consistent with this approach, this subsection states explicitly that the filing duty of the filing office is ministerial.
    See also
    Subsection (e) (pertaining to presumptions not created).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – This subsection provides that when the filing office files a record, the filing office records it as filed on the date and time of delivery to the filing office, retains the original record for the office’s records, and delivers a copy of the record to the person who delivered the record for filing with an acknowledgement of the date and time of filing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of a record transmitted electronically to the filing office, that office may make delivery by electronic transmission. The copy returned will be the exact or conformed copy if one has been required by the filing office, or will be a copy made by the filing office if an exact or conformed copy was not required.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this subsection the acceptance of a filing is evidenced merely by the filing office’s delivery of a copy of the record with an acknowledgment of the date and time of filing. The act does not provide for the filing office to issue a formal certificate of filing. A copy of the filed record together with an acknowledgment of the date and time of filing should sufficiently indicate that the filing has been accepted for filing and been filed.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       – Because of the simplification of formal filing requirements and the limited discretion granted to the filing office by this act, it is probable that rejection of records delivered to the filing office for filing will occur only rarely. This subsection provides that if the filing office does reject a record delivered for filing, the filing office must return the record to the person that submitted the filing within fifteen days together with a brief written explanation of the reason for rejection. In the case of a record delivered by electronic transmission, rejection of the record may be made electronically by the filing office or by a mailing to the person that submitted the record.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       – This subsection provides that the filing of a record by the filing office
       does not affect the validity or invalidity of any provision contained in the record and does not
       create any presumption with respect to any information in the record. Likewise, the refusal of
       the filing office to file a record creates no presumption that any of the information in the record
       is incorrect. Persons adversely affected by a statement in a filed record may contest the
       statement in a proceeding appropriate for that purpose, including a damage action under Section
       205.

       Certificate of good standing or registration. [Effective January 1, 2023.]

      On request of any person, the secretary of state shall issue a certificate of good standing for a limited partnership or a certificate of registration for a registered foreign limited partnership. The format of the certificate will be prescribed by the secretary of state.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section establishes a procedure by which anyone may obtain a conclusive certificate from the filing office that, among other things, the records of the filing office either (i) do not indicate that a particular domestic limited partnership has ceased to exist; or (ii) indicate that a particular foreign limited partnership is registered to do business in the state. The certificate will probably be a standardized form. The filing office is to make those determinations from public records only and is neither expected nor permitted to make a more extensive investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, the certificate of good standing will state whether a certificate has been filed and become effective but not that the limited partnership has been formed. For two reasons, a certificate concerning a domestic limited partnership can never conclusively indicate whether the limited partnership has actually been formed and, if formed, whether the limited partnership has been dissolved. Formation depends in part on the occurrence of an act “not of record.”
    See
    Section 201(d) (providing that a limited partnership is formed only when the certificate of limited partnership becomes effective
       <i>
        and
       </i>
       the requisite number of persons have become partners, general partners, and limited partners). Similarly, causes of dissolution are typically “not of record.”
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 801. A dissolved limited partnership may deliver for filing an amendment to the certificate of limited partnership stating that the partnership is dissolved, Section 802(b)(2)(A), and the filing of such an amendment would preclude the issuance of a certificate of good standing, Subsection (b)(2)(D)(ii). However, such an amendment is permissive as is a statement of termination.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 802(b)(2)(F). Thus, the public record might not reflect either the dissolution or termination of a limited partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(4)
       </b>
       – This provision refers only to fees, taxes, interest, and penalties collected by the filing office. In some states other agencies may report to the filing office that franchise or other taxes have been paid; in those states, this information may be included in the certificate. In states where this procedure does not unduly delay the issuance of certificates, this section may be revised appropriately. Subsection (b)(4)(B) limits the scope of the statement in the certificate that all fees, taxes, interest, and penalties have been paid to those where nonpayment affects the existence or authorization to do business of the entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(2)(D)(ii)
       </b>
       – The most likely application of this provision is an amendment to a “certificate of limited partnership to state that the partnership is dissolved.” Section 802(b)(2)(A).

       In some states, an annual or biennial report by a limited partnership or registered foreign limited partnership will be a new requirement.

       <b>
        Subsection (a)(4)

       – The requirement that the report include the name of at least one general partner will be a new requirement in some states. There has been increasing pressure from law enforcement agencies for access to more information about the ownership and control of legal entities. This requirement will enable law enforcement to contact a person with some knowledge about the affairs of the limited partnership. Members of the public will also have that ability.

       This requirement is separate from the requirement that the certificate of limited partnership always list all current general partners.

        Subsection (b)(3)
       </b>
       – A limited partnership being in part a creature of contract, consent is determined on an objective basis (
    i.e.
    , contract law’s “reasonable person” standard). Depending on the terms of a limited partnership agreement, the partners’ manifestation of consent might involve detailed formalities, entirely informal activities, or anything in between. Moreover, the partnership agreement might reduce the quantum of consent necessary or shift the consent exclusively to the general partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that a limited partnership is a voluntary association, a person cannot become a partner of a limited partnership without manifesting consent to do so. That consent also is judged objectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 106(b), “[a] person that becomes a partner is deemed to assent to the partnership agreement,” and the agreement binds the partner regardless of whether the partner has actually indicated assent in any way.
      </p>

       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>

       </b>
       – In this respect a limited partner is analogous to a shareholder in a corporation; in each case, status as owner provides neither the right to manage nor a reasonable appearance of that right. The phrase “solely by reason of being a limited partner” conforms to Subsection (b).

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)

       – The phrase “as a limited partner” indicates that: (i) this section does not disable a general partner that also owns a limited partner interest; (ii) the partnership agreement may as a matter of contract allocate managerial rights to one or more limited partners; and (iii) a separate agreement can empower and entitle a person that is a limited partner to act for the limited partnership in another capacity,
       e.g.
    , as an agent.

       </i>
       Section 305(a), cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a limited partner
       qua
    limited partner has no power to bind the limited partnership means that, subject to Section 109 (Dual Capacity), information possessed by a limited partner is not attributed to the limited partnership.

      <p>
       Elimination of the “Control Rule”
      </p>
      <p>
       ULPA (2001) eliminated the so-called “control rule,” which had impaired the liability protection accorded limited partners and had become an anachronism in a world with LLPs, LLCs and, most importantly, LLLPs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The “control rule” first appeared in a uniform act in 1916, although the concept is much older. Section 7 of the original Uniform Limited Partnership Act provided that “a limited partner shall not become liable as a general partner [
    i.e.
    , for the obligations of the limited partnership] unless ... he takes part in the control of the business.”
      </p>
      <p>
       ULPA (1976) “carrie[d] over the basic test from former Section 7,” but recognized “the difficulty of determining when the control line has been overstepped.” ULPA (1976) § 303, cmt. Accordingly, ULPA (1976) tried to buttress the limited partner’s shield by: (i) providing a safe harbor for a lengthy list of activities deemed not to constitute participating in control, Section 303(b); and (ii) limiting a limited partner’s “control rule” liability “only to persons who transact business with the limited partnership with actual knowledge of [the limited partner’s] participation in control,” Section 303(a). However, these protections were complicated by a countervailing rule which made a limited partner generally liable for the limited partnership’s obligations “if the limited partner's participation in the control of the business is . . . substantially the same as the exercise of the powers of a general partner.” Section 303(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1985 amendments to ULPA (1976) further buttressed the limited partner’s shield, removing the “substantially the same” rule, expanding the list of safe harbor activities and limiting “control rule” liability “only to persons who transact business with the limited partnership reasonably believing, based upon the limited partner's conduct, that the limited partner is a general partner.” ULPA (1976/1985) § 303(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       ULPA (2001) took the logical next step, bringing limited partners into parity with corporate shareholders, LLC members, and LLP partners.

        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – This subsection provides a corporate-like liability shield for limited partners, protecting them against the debts, obligations and other liabilities of the limited partnership –
    i.e
    ., against vicarious liability for the obligations of the entity. Because a dissolved limited partnership is nonetheless an entity formed under this act, dissolution has no effect on the liability shield.
      </p>

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section balances two countervailing concerns relating to information: the need of limited partners and former limited partners for access versus the limited partnership’s need to protect confidential business data and other intellectual property. The balance must be understood in the context of fiduciary duties. The general partners are obliged through their duties of care and loyalty to protect information whose confidentiality is important to the limited partnership or otherwise inappropriate for dissemination.
    See
    Section 409 (general standards of general partner conduct). A limited partner, in contrast, “does not have any [fiduciary] duty to the limited partnership or to any other partner solely by reason of acting as a limited partner.” Section 305(b).
      </p>
      <p>
       Like predecessor law, this act divides limited partner access rights into two categories: required information and other information. However, this act builds on predecessor law by:
      </p>
      <p>
       • expanding slightly the category of required information and stating explicitly that a limited partner may have access to that information without having to show cause;
      </p>
      <p>
       • specifying a procedure for limited partners to follow when demanding access to other information;
      </p>
      <p>
       • specifying how a limited partnership must respond to such a demand and setting a time limit for the response;
      </p>
      <p>
       • retaining predecessor law’s “just and reasonable” standard for determining a limited partner’s right to other information, while recognizing that, to be “just and reasonable,” a limited partner’s demand for other information must meet minimum standards of relatedness and particularity;
      </p>
      <p>
       • expressly requiring the limited partnership to volunteer known, material information when seeking or obtaining consent from limited partners;
      </p>
      <p>
       • codifying (while limiting) the power of the partnership agreement to vary limited partner access rights;
      </p>
      <p>
       • permitting the limited partnership to establish other reasonable limits on access; and
      </p>
      <p>
       • providing access rights for former limited partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the rights and duties stated in this section are extensive, they are not necessarily all-inclusive. This act’s statement of fiduciary duties is not exhaustive.
    See
    Section 409(a), cmt., and some cases characterize owners’ information rights as reflecting a fiduciary duty of those with management power.

        E.g., Fate v. Owens
       </i>
       , 130 N.M. 503, 511, 27 P.3d 990, 998 (2001) (stating that “[a] partner, as a fiduciary, is required to fully disclose material facts and information relating to partnership affairs to the other partners,” including limited partners);
       <i>

       </i>
       , 228 Conn. 206, 218-19, 635 A.2d 798, 804-05 (1994) (stating that “the general partner of a limited partnership has the fiduciary duty of rendering true accounts and full information about anything which affects the partnership”) (quoting

       , 189 Conn. 471, 482 n. 8, 457 A.2d 290 (1983) (internal quotations omitted). Also, the rights stated in this section are in addition to whatever discovery rights a party has in a civil suit.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, the rights of transferees are limited to those stated in this section and Subsection 702(c); general partners do not owe fiduciary duties to transferees.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rights stated in this section are personal to limited partners and transferees, and are enforceable through a direct action.
    See
    Section 901(b), cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – The phrase “required information” is a defined term.
    See
    Sections 102(21) and 108. This subsection’s broad right of access is subject not only to reasonable limitations in the partnership agreement, Section 105(c)(9), but also to the power of the limited partnership to impose reasonable limitations on use, Subsection (j). Unless the partnership agreement provides otherwise, general partners have the authority to use that power.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 406(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – The language describing the information to be provided comes essentially verbatim from ULPA (1976/1985) § 305 (2)(i) and (iii). The procedural requirements derive from the Model Business Corporation Act section 16.02(c) (2011). This subsection does not itself impose a requirement of good faith because Section 305(a) contains a generally applicable obligation of good faith and fair dealing for limited partners.
    But see
    Subsection (e)(2) (establishing a duty of good faith applicable to a former limited partner).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       – The duty stated in this subsection is at the core of the duties owed by a limited partnership and its general partners to the limited partners, and imposes an affirmative duty to volunteer information. The obligation is limited to information which is both material and known by the limited partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Knowledge” is viewed subjectively –
    i.e.
    , actual knowledge. Section 103(a)(1). A limited partnership will “know” what its general partners know. Under Section 103(f), “[a] general partner’s knowledge … of a fact relating to the limited partnership is effective immediately as knowledge of or notice to the partnership.” As to others acting or reasonably appearing to act on behalf of the limited partnership, common law agency rules will apply. RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY § 5.03 (2006) (Imputation of Notice of Fact to Principal).
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, materiality is viewed objectively. Thus, this subsection applies to known, material information, even if the limited partnership does not know that the information is material.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a violation of this subsection causes harm to a limited partner, the limited partnership is answerable in damages. In appropriate circumstances, a violation might cause a court to enjoin or even rescind an action of a limited partnership, especially when the violation has interfered with an approval or veto mechanism involving limited partner consent.
    E.g., Blue Chip Emerald LLC v. Allied Partners Inc.
    , 299 A.D.2d 278, 279-280 (N.Y. App. Div. 2002) (invoking partnership law precedent as reflecting a duty of full disclosure and holding that “[a]bsent such full disclosure, the transaction is voidable”), abrogated on other grounds by
       <i>
        Centro Empresarial Cempresa S.A. v. Am. Movil, S.A.B. de C.V.,
       </i>
       17 N.Y.3d 269, 952 N.E.2d 995 (N.Y. 2011). In addition, a limited partnership’s violation of this paragraph could give rise to a claim for damages against a general partner who, through the breach of a duty stated in Section 409, causes or suffers the limited partnership to violate this paragraph.
       <i>
        See Anthony v. Padmar, Inc.,
       </i>
       465 S.E.2d 745, 755 (S.C. Ct. App. 1995) (finding general partners made a defective disclosure prior to a vote and were therefore liable for resulting pecuniary damages to limited partners).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       – Codifying the information rights of former partners began with UPA (1997) § 403(b). Access is limited and subject to conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A person dissociated as a limited partner seeks access to information pertaining to the period during which the person was a limited partner and to which the person would have access while a limited partner. The person makes a bald demand, merely stating a desire to review the information at the limited partnership’s principal office. In particular, the demand does not describe “with reasonable particularity the information sought and the purpose for seeking the information.”
    See
    Subsection (b)(2). The limited partnership is not obliged to allow access. The person must first comply with Subsection (e), which incorporates by reference the requirements of Subsection (b).
      </p>
      <p>
       See also
    Subsection (i) (pertaining to information rights of the legal representative of a deceased limited partner).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)(2)
       </b>
       – A duty of good faith is needed here because a person claiming access under this subsection is no longer a limited partner and is no longer subject to Section 305(a).
    See
    Section 602(a)(2) (dissociation as a limited partner terminates duty of good faith as to subsequent events).

        But see id

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (h)
       </b>
       – Some old cases involved conflicts over whether a shareholder could exercise inspection rights through another person.
    White v. Coeur D'Alene Big Creek Mining Co.,
    55 P.2d 720, 723 (Idaho 1936) (stating that “[t]he refusal to permit respondent [shareholder] to appoint his own attorney or agent to make the examination [of the corporation’s books] was in effect a denial of his right” of inspection);
       <i>
        State v. Monida &amp; Yellowstone Stage Co
       </i>
       ., 124 N.W. 971, 972 (Minn. 1910) (upholding a trial court’s mandamus order, “which shall provide that [the shareholder complainant], or such attorney or agent as he may select, … shall be allowed to inspect the books, records, and papers of the defendant [corporation]”). In light of that history, for the avoidance of doubt, this subsection expressly authorizes taking action through an agent. No negative inference should be drawn about using agents to take other action under this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (i)
       </b>
       – This section provides no information rights to a person as transferee. Transferee status brings only the very limited information rights stated in Section 702(c). However, a transferee that is a person dissociated as a limited partner has rights in the latter capacity under Subsection (e).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (j)
       </b>
       – This subsection permits the limited partnership – as distinguished from the partnership agreement – to impose access and use limitations.
    See
    Section 105(c)(9) (providing that the partnership agreement may impose reasonable restrictions). Under Section 406(a), it will be the general partners that decide whether the limited partnership will impose access and use restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The limited partnership bears the burden of proving the reasonableness of any restriction imposed under this subsection. In determining whether a restriction is reasonable, a court might consider: (i) the danger or other problem the restriction seeks to avoid; (ii) the purpose for which the information is sought; and (iii) whether, in light of both the problem the restriction seeks to avoid and the purpose for which information is sought, the restriction is reasonably tailored. Restricting use of the names and addresses of limited partners is not
    per se
    unreasonable.

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – Fiduciary duty typically attaches to a person whose status or role creates significant power for that person over the interests of another person. Under this act, limited partners have very limited power of any sort in the regular activities of the limited partnership and no power whatsoever justifying the imposition of fiduciary duties either to the limited partnership or fellow partners.
    See, e.g., Lichtyger v. Franchard Corp.
    , 223 N.E.2d 869, 873 (N.Y. 1966) (“the limited partner is in a position analogous to that of a corporate shareholder, an investor who likewise has limited liability and no voice in the operation of an enterprise”) (internal quotation omitted).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is possible for a partnership agreement to allocate significant managerial authority and power to a limited partner, but in that case the power exists not as a matter of status or role but rather as a matter of contract.
    E.g., DV Realty Advisors LLC v. Policemen's Annuity &amp; Ben. Fund of Chicago
    , 75 A.3d 101, 111 (Del. 2013) (pertaining to a limited partnership agreement that allowed the limited partners to remove the general partner). The proper limit on such contract-based power is the contract itself (including the implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing), not fiduciary duty, unless the partnership agreement itself: (i) expressly imposes a fiduciary duty; or (ii) creates a role for a limited partner which, as a matter of other law, gives rise to a fiduciary duty. For example, if the partnership agreement makes a limited partner an agent for the limited partnership as to particular matters, the law of agency will impose fiduciary duties on the limited partner with respect to the limited partner’s role as agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection refers to the “contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing” to emphasize that the obligation is not an invitation to re-write agreements among the partners. At first glance, it may seem strange to apply a contractual obligation to statutory duties and rights –
    i.e.
    , duties and rights “under this [act].” However, for the most part those duties and rights apply to relationships
       <i>
        inter se
       </i>
       the partners and the limited partnership and function only to the extent not displaced by the partnership agreement. Those statutory default rules are thus intended to function like a contract; applying the contractual notion of good faith and fair dealing therefore makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a detailed discussion of the implied contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing, see Section 409(d), comment. As to the power of the partnership agreement to affect the obligation, see Section 105(c)(7) (prohibiting elimination but allowing the agreement to “prescribe the standards, if not manifestly unreasonable, by which the performance of the obligation is to be measured”).

       This section deals with the somewhat rare situation in which a person intending in good faith to be a limited partner invests in an enterprise, but:
      </p>
      
      <p>
       • the enterprise is not a limited partnership (
    i.e
    ., no certificate of limited partnership has become effective); or
      </p>
      
      <p>
       • the certificate of limited partnership has become effective but lists the person as a general partner.
      </p>
      
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – In this subsection, “good faith” does not refer to the implied contractual covenant under Section 409(d). By hypothesis, a person invoking this section is not a partner under this act. In this context, “good faith” is properly understood as referring to the notion of “clean heart, [even if] empty head.” Thus, the good faith standard here is entirely subjective, pertaining to the person’s actual state of mind regardless of whether that statement of mind is objectively reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       – The requirement that a person “withdraw[] from future participation as an owner in the enterprise” means, in part, that the person refrain from taking any further profit from the enterprise. However, the person is not required to return previously obtained profits or forfeit the investment.

      </h4>
      <p>
       A person’s status as a general partner is not dependent on the person being so designated in the certificate of limited partnership. If a person does become a general partner under this section without being so designated:
      </p>
      <p>
       • the limited partnership is obligated to promptly and appropriately amend the certificate of limited partnership, Section 202(d)(1);
      </p>
      <p>
       • each general partner that knows of the discrepancy is personally obligated to cause the certificate to be promptly and appropriately amended, Section 202(e)(1), and is subject to liability for failing to do so, Section 205(a)(2);
      </p>
      <p>
       • the “non-designated” general partner has no right to sign records which are to be filed on behalf of the limited partnership under this act, Section 203(a), except the right to sign an amendment to the certificate of limited partnership in the capacity of a person newly designated as a general partner,
       see
    Section 203(a)(5)(B);
      </p>
      <p>
       • the “non-designated” general partner has nonetheless:
      </p>
      <p>
       ! the powers of a general partner to bind the limited partnership under Sections 402 and 403; and
      </p>
      <p>
       ! the rights and duties of a general partner viz-a-viz the limited partnership and the other partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       A limited partnership’s liability under Section 402 does not depend on the “act of a general partner” being the act of a general partner designated in the certificate of limited partnership. Moreover, the notice provided by Section 103(c) does not undercut any appearance of authority. Section 402 refers only to notice under Section 103(d) and, in any event, according to the second sentence of Section 103(c), the fact that a person is not listed as in the certificate as a general partner is not notice that the person is not a general partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: By consent of the partners of XYZ Limited Partnership, Partner G is admitted as a general partner. However, XYZ’s certificate of limited partnership is not amended accordingly. Later, Partner G – acting without actual authority – purports to bind XYZ to a transaction with Third Party. Third Party does not review the filed certificate of limited partnership before entering into the transaction. XYZ will be bound under Section 402, assuming that Partner G’s action is “for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course the partnership’s activities and affairs or activities and affairs of the kind carried on by the partnership.”
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Same facts, except that Third Party does review the certificate of limited
       partnership before entering into the transaction. The result might still be the same. The
       omission of a person’s name from the certificate’s list of general partners is not notice
       that the person is not a general partner. Therefore, Third Party’s review of the certificate
       does not mean that Third Party knew, had received a notification or had notice that
       Partner G lacked authority. At most, XYZ could argue that, because Third Party knew
       that Partner G was not listed in the certificate, a transaction entered into by Partner G could not reasonably appear to Third Party to be for apparently carrying on the limited
       partnership’s activities in the ordinary course. For a discussion of the reasonableness
       requirement, see Section 402(a), comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(3)
       </b>
       – A limited partnership being in part a creature of contract, consent is determined on an objective basis
       (i.e.
    , contract law’s “reasonable person” standard). Depending on the terms of the partnership agreement, the partners’ manifestation of consent might involve
       detailed formalities, entirely informal activities, or anything in between. Moreover, the partnership agreement might reduce the quantum of consent necessary or shift the consent right
       to the general partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       A limited partnership being a voluntary association, a person cannot become a partner without manifesting consent to do so. That consent also is judged objectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 106(b), “[a] person that becomes a partner is deemed to assent to the partnership agreement,” and the agreement binds the partner regardless of whether the partner has actually indicated assent in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(1)
       </b>
       – To accommodate business practices and also because a limited partnership need not have a business purpose, this provision permits so-called “non-economic partners.”

        Derivation

       – ULPA (2001) derived this section from UPA (1997) § 301(1), which was
       derived from UPA (1914) § 9. For further information on the derivation, see UPA (1997) (Last
       Amended 2013) § 301, comment.

      <p>
       At common law, a general partner was considered a general agent of the partnership.

       RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY § 14A cmt. a (1958), and the mere status of a general
       partner “clothes” a person with apparent authority to carry on the partnership business.
       Stockwell v. U.S.,
    80 U.S. 531, 567 (1871);
       <i>
        Lincoln Nat. Bank v. Schoen,

        Kansallis Finance Ltd. v. Fern
       </i>
       , 659 N.E.2d 731, 733, 740 (Mass. 1996). In 1914, the Uniform Partnership Act codified this principle, UPA (1914) § 9 (Partner Agent of Partnership as to Partnership Business), and “statutory apparent authority” has been part of uniform partnerships acts ever since.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       UPA (1997) § 301 (Partner Agent of Partnership; ULPA (2001) § 402 (General Partner Agent of Limited Partnership).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section’s principal purpose is to delineate a general partner’s statutory apparent
       authority. The partnership agreement and Section 406 govern the rights of the partners among
       themselves, including the right to restrict a general partner’s actual authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – This subsection reflects the basic common law principles, as first codified in UPA (1914) § 9(1) and later in UPA (1997) § 301(1). In effect, the subsection characterizes a general partner as a general managerial agent of the limited partnership. Such agents have both actual and apparent authority, and this section delineates the apparent authority. For a discussion of the scope of actual authority, see Section 406(a) and (b), cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The agency law origins of statutory apparent authority have informed courts’ application of UPA (1914) § 9(1), and that case law is equally applicable under this act. For example, although the statutory language does not appear to require that the appearance of authority be reasonable, the case law does so routinely.
       See, e.g., In re Fox Hill Office Invs., Ltd.,
    101 B.R. 1007, 1019 (Bankr. W.D. Mo. 1989) (stating a third-party lender in possession of a copy of a limited partnership’s partnership agreement was on notice of the general partner’s lack of authority and therefore should have inquired as to the partner’s authority),
       <i>
        aff'd
       </i>
       ,
       926 F.2d 752 (8th Cir. 1991);
       <i>
        Investors Title Ins. Co. v. Herzig,
       </i>
       360 S.E.2d 786, 789 (N.C. 1987) (stating that “in order to hold the [partnership] liable, [a third party] must show that in the exercise of reasonable care under the circumstances, it was justified in believing that the principal had conferred . . . authority to [act] on behalf of the partnership”);
       <i>
        First Interstate Bank of Oregon,
        N.A. v. Bergendahl
       </i>
       , 723 P.2d 1005, 1010 (Or. Ct. App. 1986) (stating that bank in possession of management agreement was on notice of general partner’s restricted authority and could not rely on a theory of apparent authority).
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, per the law of apparent authority, a general partner can bind a partnership under this section even if the partner intends to take and does take the resulting benefits for the partner’s own benefit.
       See Wolfe v. Harms
    , 413 S.W.2d 204, 216 (Mo. 1967) (stating that partnership is liable for partner’s acts “even if the predominant motive of the partner was to benefit himself or third persons”);
       <i>
        Rouse v. Pollard,
       </i>
       18 A.2d 5, 7 (N.J. Eq. 1941) (“All the partners are responsible for the act of one of their number as agent, even though he acts for some secret purpose of his own, and not really for the benefit of the [partnership].”),
       <i>
        aff'd
       </i>
       ,
       21 A.2d 801 (N.J. Eq. 1941);
       <i>
        Investors Title Ins. Co. v. Herzig
       </i>
       , 360 S.E.2d 786, 788 (N.C. 1987) (stating that the mere fact that the partner’s act was for personal gain was not enough to justify summary judgment for the partnership on the subject of the partnership’s liability for the act).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a person is not listed in the certificate of limited partnership as a general partner is not notice that the person is not a partner and is not notice that the person lacks authority to act for the limited partnership.
       See
    Section 103(c) and Section 401, cmt. In contrast, several filings under Section 103(d) may provide notice “to the world” that a person lacks authority to bind a limited partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: For the past ten years, Partner X has been a general partner of XYZ Limited Partnership and has regularly conducted the limited partnership’s business with Third Party. However, 100 days ago the limited partnership expelled Partner X as a general partner and the next day delivered for filing an amendment to XYZ’s certificate of limited partnership which stated that Partner X was no longer a general partner. On that same day, the filing officer filed the amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today Partner X approaches Third Party, purports still be to a general partner of XYZ and purports to enter into a transaction with Third Party on XYZ’s behalf. Third Party is unaware that Partner X has been expelled and has no reason to doubt Partner X’s bona fides. Nonetheless, XYZ is not liable on the transaction. Under Section 103(d)(1), Third Party has notice that Partner X is dissociated and perforce has notice that Partner X is not a general partner authorized to bind XYZ because Third Party is deemed to have notice ninety days after the amendment became effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reference to “signing of a record in the partnership’s name” encompasses records that purport to convey title to realty.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – Under this provision, a general partner that lacks both actual and statutory apparent authority entirely lacks the power to bind the entity.
       Accord
    RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY, ch. 2, Introductory Note (2006) (stating that “this Restatement… does not use the concept of inherent agency power”).
       <i>
        But see
       </i>
       Section 403, cmt. (explaining that, under that section, a general partner may bind a limited partnership by unauthorized and wrongful conduct as to which the apparent authority
       <i>
        vel non
       </i>
       is irrelevant).
      </p>
      <p>
       Agency law determines whether a general partner has actual authority in any particular situation.
       See
    RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY § 3.01 (2006) (Creation of Actual Authority). For delineation of a general partner’s actual authority when this act’s default management rules remain in effect, see Section 406(a),(b), cmt. However, the partnership agreement will typically be the primary source of a general partner’s actual authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection does not affect a limited partnership’s power to ratify a general partner’s unauthorized act.
       See
    RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY (2006), Chapter 4 (Ratification).

        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – This provision is derived from UPA (1914) § 13 (Partnership Bound by Partner’s Wrongful Act) as modernized by UPA (1997) § 305(a) (Partnership Liable for Partner’s Actionable Conduct) and for the most part parallels the agency law doctrine of
       respondeat superior. See
    RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY § 14A cmt. a (1958) (“When one of the partners is in active management of the business or is otherwise regularly employed in the business, he is a servant of the partnership.”). The liability is vicarious and without regard to the fault of those managing the partnership. For more information on the historical development of this section, see UPA (1997) (Last Amended 2013) 305(a), comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       To successfully invoke this provision, a plaintiff must show: (i) “a wrongful act or omission, or other actionable conduct” by a general partner; (ii) that caused “loss or injury”; and (iii) that at the relevant moment, the general partner was acting with actual authority, apparent authority (if relevant), or within “the ordinary course of activities and affairs of the partnership.” Extrapolating from agency law, apparent authority is relevant only when the appearance of authority augments the impact of the wrongful act.
       See
    RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY, § 7.08 (2006) (“A principal is subject to vicarious liability for a tort committed by an agent in dealing or communicating with a third party on or purportedly on behalf of the principal when actions taken by the agent with apparent authority constitute the tort or enable the agent to conceal its commission.”).
      </p>
      <p>
       An act or omission may be “in the ordinary course of activities and affairs of the partnership” even though the act is wrongful. Any other interpretation would vitiate the “ordinary course” element. “The proper question … is not whether the specific wrongful act is ‘ordinary course’ …, but rather whether that type of act, if done rightfully, would be.” DANIEL S. KLEINBERGER, AGENCY, PARTNERSHIP AND LLCS: EXAMPLES AND EXPLANATIONS § 10.5.1 at 350 (4th ed., Wolters Kluwer, 2012) (emphasis omitted).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in
       Jackson v. Jackson
    , 20 N.C.App. 406, 408, 201 S.E.2d 722, 724 (N.C.App. 1974), the North Carolina Court of Appeals stated that, while “[a]dvising the initiation of a criminal prosecution is clearly within the normal range of activities for a typical law partnership, ... taking such action maliciously and without probable cause is quite a different matter.” The court held that “[i]n view of [ethics] rules, which clearly forbid any attempt by a lawyer to prosecute a person without cause, it cannot be held that malicious prosecution is within the ordinary course of business of a law partnership.”
       <i>
        Id
       </i>
       . It is difficult to identify a reasonable limit to this approach. Presumably, at least, a partner's “plain vanilla” malpractice is within a law firm's ordinary course of business despite the ethical rules requiring lawyers to act zealously and competently.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, Subsection (a) refers to “the ordinary course of activities and affairs of the
       partnership
    ” (emphasis added); thus the proper question is whether the conduct is in the ordinary course for the partnership and not whether the particular general partner ordinarily plays a role in that part of the partnership’s business.

       – This provision is derived from UPA (1914) § 14 (Partnership Bound by Partner’s Breach of Trust) and UPA (1997) § 305(b) (Partnership Liable for Partner’s Actionable Conduct). It is not necessary that the general partner “receiv[ing] or caus[ing] the partnership to receive money or property” do so wrongfully. Culpability is necessary at the second phase –
       i.e.
    , when “the money or property is misapplied by a general partner.”

        Derivation
       </b>
       – ULPA (2001) derived this section from UPA (1997) § 306, which was also the source for ULLCA (2006) § 304. The Harmonization Project brought the two partnership acts and the limited liability company act into accord to the extent the three acts overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – Until the advent of limited liability partnerships and limited liability limited partnerships, one hallmark of general partner status was strict, vicarious liability for the debts, obligations, and other liabilities of the partnership. This subsection states a modern version of that venerable rule. The Harmonization Project made no substantive changes to this subsection.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – UPA (1997) continued the approach of UPA (1914) §§ 17 and 41(7) to the vicarious liability of an incoming partner, but used a simpler and clearer formulation. ULPA (2001) followed UPA (1997), and the Harmonization Project made no substantive changes to this subsection.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regard to when a limited partnership incurs a debt, obligation, or other liability, the case law is scant and concerns contractual and similar obligations. The leading case is
       Conklin Farm v. Leibowitz
    , 140 N.J. 417, 658 A.2d 1257 (1995), which holds that: (i) obligations on a loan, whether for interest or principal, are incurred when the loan is made, not when each particular payment is due; and (ii) obligations for lease payments are incurred when each rental payment is due, not when the lease is made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conklin
    concerned a partnership loan obligation that was: (i) entered into before a particular partner joined the partnership; but (ii) for the most part, was payable afterwards. The court held that “interest is part of the contractual debt, and the obligation to pay interest on a loan
       <i>
        arises
       </i>
       , if at all, at the time that the parties execute the note or other debt instrument.”
       <i>
        Conklin
       </i>
       ,
       140 N.J. at 423,425, 658 A.2d at 1261 (emphasis in original). The court indicated that the same analysis applies to the obligation to repay principal.
       140 N.J. at 429, 658 A.2d at 1263 (stating that "the decisive issue before this court … [is that] [p]ayment of interest, like repayment of advances, is an obligation that arises at the time the debt instrument is executed").
      </p>
      <p>
       Conklin
    discussed the lease issue in response to the creditor's argument that “just as a rent obligation arises for current use of property, an interest obligation arises for current use of principal.”
       <i>
        Conklin
       </i>
       ,
       140 N.J. at 425, 658 A.2d at 1261. Rejecting that argument, the court: (i) noted "the
       <i>
        common-law
       </i>
       obligation to pay rent based on current tenancy [which]... arises with each period of tenancy, and ... arises even in the absence of a lease”; (ii) described "the common-law obligation to pay rent [as] entirely independent of the contractual obligation under the lease"; and (iii) held that, for purposes of partnership law, the rule for "incurring" a lease obligation rests on the common law duty in tenancy and not on the lease as a contract.
       <i>
        Conklin
       </i>
       ,
       140 N.J. at 426, 658 A.2d at 1262 (citing
       <i>
        Ellingson v. Walsh, O'Connor &amp; Barneson
       </i>
       , 15 Cal. 2d 673, 104 P.2d 507, 508 (1940)).
       <i>
        Conklin
       </i>
       involved a general partnership but, in this context, that difference is immaterial.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to when a partnership incurs a tort liability, the answer might be found by analogy to statute of limitation rules, another area of law concerned with when claims arise. “Although the courts have not been consistent … the interpretation of [when] a … statute [of limitations begins to run] as applied to torts has been such that the statute does not usually begin to run until the tort is complete.... A tort is ordinarily not complete until there has been an invasion of a legally protected interest of the plaintiff.”
       RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 899 cmt c. (1979);
       Loehr v. Ventura Cnty. Cmty. Coll. Dist
    ., 147 Cal. App. 3d 1071, 1078, 195 Cal. Rptr. 576 (Ct. App. 1983). By analogy, a limited partnership would incur liability for a tort when the harm occurs.
       <i>
        See, e.g., Jones v. Cox
       </i>
       , 828 P.2d 218, 224 (Colo. 1992) (“A cause of action has commonly been understood to ‘accrue’ when a suit may be maintained thereon.”) (quoting BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 19 (5th ed. 1979));
       <i>
        Loehr v. Ventura Cnty. Cmty. Coll. Dist.
       </i>
       , 147 Cal. App. 3d 1071, 1078, 195 Cal. Rptr. 576 (Ct. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, a policy argument exists to the contrary. Vicarious liability for a limited partnership's torts should be confined to persons who are general partners when the wrongful conduct occurs. It is the conduct, not the consequences, that is wrongful; therefore, the occurrence of the wrongful conduct should determine which set of general partners are liable for the conduct's consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       For further discussion of the “incurred” issue, see Subsection (c), comment (The Temporal Nexus –When Claim Incurred).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       – This subsection provides a corporate/LLC-like liability shield for general partners, protecting them from (and only from) the debts, obligations and liabilities of the limited partnership –
    i.e
    ., against a partner’s alleged vicarious liability for the obligations of the entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shield Applicable Regardless of the Identity of the Plaintiff
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes the shield relevant is the nature of the claim. If the complaint seeks to hold a partner vicariously liability for the LLLP’s obligations, the shield applies. If not, not. Thus, there is no distinction among a claim arising from an LLLP’s debt to a commercial creditor, a partner’s claim that the LLLP has failed to return a contribution as required by the partnership agreement, and a claim by a former partner that the LLLP has failed to follow through on a buy-out agreement.
       See Rappaport v. Gelfand,
    197 Cal. App. 4th 1213, 1230-1232, 129 Cal. Rptr. 3d 670, 682-84 (Cal.App. 2 Dist. 2011) (involving a claim by a former partner).
       <i>
        Accord Ederer v. Gursky
       </i>
       , 9 N.Y.3d 514, 526, 881 N.E.2d 204, 212-213 (N.Y. 2007) (Smith, J., dissenting).
      </p>
      <p>
       Shield Inapposite for Claims Arising from a Partner’s Own Conduct
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the partner liability at issue is solely vicarious, the LLLP shield is irrelevant to claims seeking to hold a partner directly liable on account of the partner’s own conduct. Case law on this issue comes from the analogous context of limited liability companies, and in that context a few judges have failed to understand this point.
       See
    ULLCA (2006) (Last Amended 2013) § 304(a), cmt. (Shield Inapposite for Claims Arising from a Member’s or Manager’s Own Conduct). However, the overwhelming weight of case law is contrary, as are the actual words of shield provisions (immunizing only for obligations of the entity and making no reference to direct obligations of an owner or manager) and public policy (which recoils from the idea of immunizing a person’s misconduct solely because the person acts on behalf of an organization).
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A general partner personally guarantees a debt of a limited liability limited partnership. Subsection (c) is irrelevant to the general partner’s liability as guarantor.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A general partner purports to bind a limited liability limited partnership while lacking any agency law power to do so. The LLLP is not bound, but the partner is liable for having breached the “warranty of authority” (an agency law doctrine). Subsection (c) does not apply. The liability is not
       for
    a debt, obligation, or other liability of the LLLP, but is rather the partner’s own, direct liability. Indeed, the liability exists because the LLLP is
       <i>
        not
       </i>
       indebted, obligated or liable.
       RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY § 6.10 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A general partner of a limited liability limited partnership defames a third party in circumstances that render the LLLP vicariously liable under Section 403(a). Under Subsection (c), the third party cannot hold the partner accountable for the
       partnership’s
    liability, but that protection is immaterial. The partner is the tortfeasor and in that role is directly liable to the third party.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: An LLLP provides professional services, and one of its general partners commits malpractice. The liability shield is irrelevant to the partner’s direct liability in tort. However, if the partner’s malpractice liability is attributed to the partnership under Section 403(a), the liability shield will protect the other general partners against a claim that they must make good on the LLLP’s liability. The same analysis applies if the plaintiff also successfully claims that another general partner was negligent in supervising the first partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) pertains only to claims based on the LLLP’s liability and is irrelevant to claims by a limited liability limited partnership or a partner against a general partner and
       vice versa. See
    Sections 409 (pertaining to management duties) and 901 (pertaining to direct claims by a partner).
      </p>
      <p>
       Shield Inapposite to Role Liability Claims
      </p>
      <p>
       Provisions of regulatory law may impose liability on a general partner of an LLLP due to a role the general partner plays in the limited partnership.
       See, e.g., Food Team Intern., Ltd. v. Unilink, LLC
    , 872 F. Supp. 2d 405, 424 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (holding several individuals “subject to secondary individual liability under PACA [Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act]” because their roles within a limited liability company enabled them to control the relevant assets) (citing
       <i>
        Bear Mountain Orchards, Inc. v. Mich–Kim, Inc.
       </i>
       , 623 F.3d 163, 172 (3d Cir. 2010)). Subsection (c) does not affect this “role liability.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The Temporal Nexus – When Claim Incurred
      </p>
      <p>
       The LLLP shield functions only with respect to obligations incurred while the partnership is a limited liability limited partnership. The shield does not protect general partners from vicarious liability for partnership obligations incurred before a partnership becomes an LLLP or after the partnership ends its LLLP status. Sections 201(b)(5) and 406(b)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       For a preliminary discussion of when a partnership obligation is incurred, see Subsection (b), comment. It could well be argued that “incurred” under Subsection (c) has the same meaning as “incurred” under Subsection (b).
       IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez,
    546 U.S. 21, 34, 126 S. Ct. 514, 523 (2005) (referring to "the normal rule of statutory interpretation that identical words used in different parts of the same statute are generally presumed to have the same meaning");
       <i>
        Timberline Air Serv., Inc. v. Bell Helicopter-Textron, Inc
       </i>
       ., 125 Wash. 2d 305, 313, 884 P.2d 920, 925 (1994) (stating that "[w]hen the same words are used in different parts of the same statute, it is presumed that the Legislature intended that the words have the same meaning").
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the argument should yield if the subsections' different contexts raise different issues of policy. 1A SUTHERLAND STATUTES AND STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION § 45:12 (7th ed.) (stating that “departure from the literal construction of a statute is justified when such a construction would produce an absurd and unjust result and would clearly be inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the act in question”).
       See, e.g., S.V. v. R.V
    ., 933 S.W.2d 1, 4 (Tex. 1996) (“[W]e have held that a cause of action accrues when a wrongful act causes some legal injury, even if the fact of injury is not discovered until later, and even if all resulting damages have not yet occurred. We have not applied this rule without exception, however, and have sometimes held that an action does not accrue until the plaintiff knew or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known of the wrongful act and resulting injury.”) (citations omitted).
      </p>
      <p>
       The case law concerning contractual obligations (incurred when the contract is made) applies appropriately in the context of the LLLP shield. However, the lease case law is problematic. If an obligation is incurred each time rent is due, subsection(c) is a trap for the unwary landlord.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Ordinary limited partnership enters into a lease with a commercial landlord. Knowing that each general partner is automatically liable for the partnership's debt, the landlord does not obtain personal guarantees. Subsequently, the partnership becomes an LLLP. If future rent payments are incurred when due, and not as of when the lease was made, the landlord loses a very important part of the bargain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, for the purposes of Subsection (c), lease obligations should be treated as contractual obligations, incurred when the contract is made.
      </p>
      <p>
       A similar issue exists with regard to tort liability. Courts must look to when the conduct causing the injury takes place and not to when actual injury occurs. Otherwise, a limited partnership could: (i) engage in wrongful conduct that does not cause immediate injury; (ii) come to realize that the conduct has occurred; (iii) subsequently amend its certificate of limited partnership to become a limited liability limited partnership; and (iv) thereby eliminate the vicarious liability of its general partners for all harm subsequently arising from the misconduct.
       Cf. Savini v. Univ. of Hawaii,
    113 Haw. 459, 465, 153 P.3d 1144, 1150 (2007) (addressing the question of when a statute of limitations begins to run for bodily injury, when another statute precludes bringing a claim until the amount of damages has reach a specified threshold).
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, courts should determine the “incurred” question under Subsection (c) so that the LLLP shield protects the general partners of an LLLP to the same extent that the corporate and LLC shields protect corporate shareholders and LLC members. From that perspective, LLLP status obtained after a limited partnership commits a wrongful act should provide no greater protection for the general partners than the protection a sole proprietor obtains by forming an LLC after committing a wrongful act –
    i.e
    ., none.
       <i>
        See, e.g., Foxchase, LLP v. Cliatt
       </i>
       , 562 S.E. 2d 221, 224 (Ga. Ct. App. 2002) (holding that a partnership's liability shield did not protect partners from claims of property damage caused by the construction of a golf course, where the jury could have found that the “damage ... occurred when they, not the partnership, owned the course”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(2)
       </b>
       –
       The Shield and Dissolution
    . The rule stated here is inherent in the nature of partnership dissolution. “[D]issolution does not end a limited partnership’s existence but rather changes the purpose of that existence.” Section 801, cmt. “A dissolved limited partnership shall wind up its business and… continues after dissolution … for the purpose of winding up.” Section 802(a). Put another way: dissolution and winding up are part of the life cycle of a limited liability limited partnership – sometimes the most complicated part. There is no logical reason to remove the shield during the last part of a LLLP’s partnership’s life cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection makes this point expressly, because it is possible to misinterpret some outlying LLP cases as holding to the contrary.
       See, e.g., Carolina Cas. Ins. Co. v. L.M. Ross Law Grp., LLP
    , 151 Cal. Rptr. 3d 628, 635 (2012) (affirming the trial court’s decision to hold an LLP’s named partner liable for a judgment against his limited ability partnership; noting that “[c]entral to the decision to amend the judgment to add Ross [the named partner] as a judgment debtor … is the trial court's finding that Ross Law Group dissolved”; recognizing, however, that, before the partnership incurred the liability, Ross had signed and filed with the California Secretary of State a form stating that the law firm had “cease[d] to be a registered limited liability partnership and is hereby filing this notice with the California Secretary of State that [it] is no longer a registered limited partnership”) (quotation marks omitted).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Shield and Termination.
    This subsection does not expressly provide that, when a limited liability limited partnership’s existence terminates, the liability shield remains in place as to any debt, obligation, or other liability of the partnership incurred before the termination. However, the point follows ineluctably from this subsection, which adopts an “occurrence” rather than a “claims made” basis for determining whether the shield applies. See the comment to Subsection (c), above (The Temporal Nexus –When Claim Incurred).
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, any other result would: (i) create huge holes in the shield; (ii) put the law of unincorporated businesses at odds with the law of corporations; (iii) render surplus this act’s distribution recapture provision, Section 407; (iv) render meaningless the exception to the notice requirement as stated in Sections 806b)(5) and 807(b)(4); and (v) render nonsensical the otherwise logical extension of the equitable trust fund theory to limited liability limited partnerships.
       Cf. Velasquez v. Franz,
    589 A.2d 143, 146 (N.J. 1991) (explaining that “the trust-fund doctrine… renders shareholders who receive distributed assets of the corporation liable as ‘trustees’ for claims of the corporation's creditors”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       – This subsection was added during the Harmonization Project and pertains to the equitable doctrine of “piercing the veil” –
       i.e
    ., conflating an entity and its owners to hold one liable for the obligations of the other. The doctrine of “piercing the corporate veil” is well-established, and courts should apply the doctrine to limited liability limited partnership for the same reasons that courts have regularly (and sometimes almost reflexively) applied the doctrine to limited liability companies.
       <i>
        Cf. Axtmann v. Chillemi
       </i>
       , 2007 ND 179, 740 N.W.2d 838, 847 (stating that “the shield of a limited liability partnership may be pierced under ‘the case law that states the conditions and circumstances under which the corporate veil or limited liability shield of a corporation may be pierced under North Dakota law....’”) (quoting N.D.C.C.
       § 45-22-09(1)).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, LLLP piercing involves one important distinction from the corporate realm. While under corporate law “disregard of corporate formalities” is a key piercing factor, that factor is inapposite in the law of unincorporated organizations. Corporate formalities reflect statutory mandates. LLLP formalities derive for the most part from the agreement among the partners. From a policy perspective, disregarding formalities adopted by agreement differs substantially from disregarding formalities imposed by law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, because the terms of a partnership agreement may be “implied,” Section 102(14), an LLLP’s ongoing disregard of formalities may well constitute an amendment to the partnership agreement. If so, disregard equals amendment, and the concept of “disregard of formalities” makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, this subsection is inapposite to another key piercing factor – disregard of the separateness between entity and owner.
       Cf. Vanderford Co. v. Knudson
    , 165 P.3d 261, 271 (Idaho 2007) (noting that managing member and “his accountant testified that the LLC's checking account was so confusing that the accountant could not be sure whose money was in the account at what times”);
       <i>
        Utzler v. Braca
       </i>
       , 972 A.2d 743 (Conn. App. 2009) (holding that veil piercing was appropriate under alter-ego theory when owner deposited LLC funds into a commingled bank account from which he made withdrawals for personal needs and unrelated projects).
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: The sole general partner of a limited liability limited partnership uses a car titled in the partnership’s name for personal purposes and writes checks on the partnership’s account to pay for personal expenses. These facts are relevant to a piercing claim; they pertain to economic separateness, not Subsection (b) formalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection addresses claims to “impos[e] liability on a general partner for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the partnership” –
    i.e
    ., for what is sometimes termed a “direct pierce.” Whether the same approach should apply to claims for a “reverse pierce” is a question for the courts.
       <i>
        See Comm'r of Envtl. Prot. v. State Five Indus. Park, Inc
       </i>
       ., 304 Conn. 128, 140, 37 A.3d 724, 732-33 (2012) (stating that “[a]lthough some courts have adopted reverse veil piercing with little distinction as a logical corollary of traditional veil piercing, because the two share the same equitable goals, others wisely have recognized important differences between them”).
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection has no relevance to a partner’s claim that the disregard of agreed-upon formalities is a breach of the limited partnership agreement.
      </p>

        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – If a debt, obligation, or other liability is incurred against a limited liability limited partnership, joining a general partner would be improper. Likewise, if a debt, obligation, or other liability against an ordinary limited partnership is incurred before a person becomes a general partner, it would be improper to join that person. As for when a claim is incurred, see Section 404(b) and (c), comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reference to “not inconsistent with Section 404” is the procedural analog to the substantive protections of Section 404(b) (incoming general partner not liable for pre-existing limited partnership obligations) and (c) (general partner not liable for partnership obligations incurred by an LLLP). When a general partner has personally guaranteed a limited partnership obligation, naming that general partner in a suit against the limited partnership is “not inconsistent with Section 404.”

    Section 404, cmt. ( Shield Inapposite for Claims Arising from a Partner’s Conduct).

       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – As explained in the Prefatory Note to ULPA (2001), this act assumes that, more often than not, people utilizing the act will want: (i) strong centralized management, strongly entrenched; and (ii) passive investors with little control over the entity. Section 302 essentially excludes limited partners from the ordinary management of a limited partnership’s activities and affairs, unless the partnership agreement provides otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection states affirmatively the general partners’ commanding role. Only the partnership agreement and the express provisions of this act can limit that role.
      </p>
      <p>
       The authority granted by this subsection includes the authority to delegate. Delegation does not relieve the delegating general partner or partners of their duties under Section 409. However, the fact of delegation is a fact relevant to any breach of duty analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A sole general partner personally handles all important paperwork for a limited partnership. The general partner neglects to renew the fire insurance coverage on a building owned by the limited partnership, despite having received and read a warning notice from the insurance company. The building subsequently burns to the ground and is a total loss. The general partner might be liable for breach of the duty of care under Section 409(c) (gross negligence).
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A sole general partner delegates responsibility for insurance renewals to the limited partnership’s office manager, and that manager neglects to renew the fire insurance coverage on the building. Even assuming that the office manager has been grossly negligent, the general partner is not necessarily liable under Section 409(c). The office manager’s gross negligence is not automatically attributed to the general partner. Under Section 409(c), the question is whether the general partner was grossly negligent (or worse) in selecting the office manager, delegating insurance renewal matters to the office manager, and supervising the office manager after the delegation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement may also provide for delegation and, subject to Section 105(c)(6)-(8) and (d)(2), may modify a general partner’s duties under Section 409.
      </p>
      <p>
       For limited partnerships that have more than one general partner, this act provides that in most circumstances a “matter relating to the activities and affairs of the partnership is decided … by a majority of the general partners.” However, unlike corporate statutes, this act does not provide a rule for the quantum of participation necessary to constitute “a majority.”
       Cf., e.g
    .,
       MINN. STAT. § 302A.237 (2014) (providing rules for determining the votes need to constitute “an act of the board”). If a limited partnership has more than one general partner, the partnership agreement should consider what “a majority” means in the event a general partner position is vacant. Note also that for some decisions this act requires the affirmative vote or consent of all partners.

    ., Sections 301(b)(3) (for a person to become a limited partner after formation of the limited partnership), 401(b)(3) (same as to becoming a general partner), and 502(3) (for compromising a person’s obligation to make a contribution). In addition, the transactions authorized under Article 11 each have a default unanimous consent requirement.

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsections (a) and (b)
       </b>
       – These subsections have important implications for a partner’s actual authority to act on behalf of the partnership. The actual authority of a general partner is a question of agency law,
       see
    RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY § 3.01 (2006) (Creation of Actual Authority), and depends fundamentally on the contents of the partnership agreement. If, however, the partnership agreement is silent on the issue, this subsection helps delineate that actual authority. Acting individually, a general partner:
      </p>
      <p>
       • has no actual authority to commit the limited partnership to any matter for which this act require requires the affirmative vote or consent of all partners;
      </p>
      <p>
       • has the actual authority to commit the limited partnership to usual and customary matters, unless the general partner has reason to know that: (i) other general partners might disagree; or (ii) for some other reason consultation with fellow general partners is appropriate; and
      </p>
      <p>
       • has no actual authority to take unusual or non-customary actions that will have a substantial effect on the limited partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first point follows self-evidently from the language of this act. Where this act requires unanimity of all partners, no general partner could reasonably believe to the contrary (unless the partnership agreement provided otherwise).
      </p>
      <p>
       The second point follows because:
      </p>
      <p>
       • Subsection (a) serves as the gap-filler manifestation from the limited partnership to its general partners and does
       <span class="s1">
        not
       </span>
       require partners to act
       <span class="s1">
        only
       </span>
       in concert or after consultation. To the contrary, subject to the partnership agreement, this subsection expressly provides that “[e]ach general partner has equal rights in the management and conduct of the limited partnership’s activities and affairs.”
      </p>
      <p>
       • It would be impractical to require collective action on even the smallest of decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       • However, to the extent a general partner has reason to know of a possible difference of opinion among the general partners, this subsection requires a decision by “a majority of the general partners.”
      </p>
      <p>
       A third point is a matter of common sense. The more serious the matter, the less likely it is that a general partner has actual authority to act unilaterally.
       Cf
    .
       RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY § 3.03, cmt. c (2006) (noting the unreasonableness of believing, without more facts, that an individual has “an unusual degree of unilateral authority over a matter fraught with enduring consequences for the institution” and stating that “[t]he gravity of the matter from the standpoint of the organization is relevant to whether a third party could reasonably believe that the manager has authority to proceed unilaterally”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       – In a limited partnership, winding up is one of the tasks for which the limited partners depend on the general partner. There is no reason for this act to single out this particular task as giving rise to compensation.

      </h4>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – The phrase “required information” is a defined term.
       See
    Sections 102(21) and 108. This subsection’s broad right of access is subject both to reasonable limitations in the partnership agreement, Section 105(c)(9), and also the power of the limited partnership to impose reasonable limitations on use, Subsection (j). However, limiting a general partner’s access to this information or any other information would be quite unusual.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – This subsection states the rule pertaining to information memorialized in “any record maintained by the partnership.” Except in unusual circumstances (
    e.g
    ., a back-up general partner with no ongoing responsibilities), all of the information encompassed by this provision will be “material to the general partner’s rights and duties under the partnership agreement or this [act].” For further discussion of the meaning of “material” as applied to information, see Section 409(f), comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       – Because a limited partnership is an entity, this subsection imposes a duty on the partnership, not the partners. However, the general partners are typically responsible for seeing that the limited partnership fulfills this obligation. For the limited partnership, breaching this obligation is a matter of strict liability (analogous to breaching a contract). In contrast, Section 409 provides the standard for evaluating a general partner’s conduct in this context. Subsection (d) establishes a separate duty for the general partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       A general partner’s right to information under this subsection is personal to the general partner and enforceable under Section 901(a). These rights are in addition to whatever discovery rights a party has in a civil suit.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(1)
       </b>
       – This provision imposes an affirmative duty to volunteer information. However, given the assumption that each general partner will be active in management, the obligation ceases “to the extent the partnership can establish that it reasonably believes the general partner already knows the information.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, the obligation is limited to information which is both material and known by the limited partnership. “Knowledge” is viewed subjectively –
       i.e
    ., actual knowledge. Section 103(a)(1). Materiality is viewed objectively. Thus, the duty applies to known, material information, even if the limited partnership does not know that the information is material.
      </p>
      <p>
       A limited partnership will “know” what its general partners know. Under Section 103(f), “[a] general partner’s knowledge … of a fact relating to the limited partnership is effective immediately as knowledge of or notice to the partnership.” As to others acting or reasonably appearing to act on behalf of the limited partnership, common law agency rules will apply.
       RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY § 5.03 (2006) (Imputation of Notice of Fact to Principal).
      </p>
      <p>
       Typically a general partner’s duties are continuous, and therefore a general partner’s right to information is not just transaction-specific. Ongoing managerial responsibilities require ongoing information – both periodically and
       ad hoc
    when a situation warrants.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the meaning of “material” as applied to information, see Section 409(f), comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(2)
       </b>
       – Other law determines which party has the burden of proof as to the stated exception.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       – This subsection imposes a duty directly on each general partner. The duty is both narrower and more demanding than the duty placed on general partners as the typically responsible parties under Subsection (c). The duty is narrower because the relevant information is confined to “the information [pertaining to records] described in subsection (b),” rather than the wide scope of “any information” delineated by Subsection (c). The duty is more demanding because it applies directly to the general partners, is therefore in the nature of a contractual obligation, and its breach is a matter of strict liability. For example, it is no defense for a general partner under this section to assert that, although the partner failed to furnish required information, the failure did not amount to gross negligence under Section 409(c).
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A limited partnership has two general partners: each of which is regularly engaged in conducting the limited partnership’s activities; both of which are aware of and have regular access to all significant limited partnership records; and neither of which has special responsibility for or knowledge of any particular aspect of those activities or the relevant partnership records. Most likely, neither general partner is obliged to draw the other general partner’s attention to information apparent in the limited partnership’s records.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Although a limited partnership has three general partners, one is the managing partner with day-to-day responsibility for running the limited partnership’s activities. The other two meet periodically with the managing general partner, and together with that partner function in a manner analogous to a corporate board of directors. Most likely, the managing general partner has a duty to draw the attention of the other general partners to important information, even if that information would be apparent from a review of the limited partnership’s records.
      </p>
      <p>
       As with Subsection (c), a general partner’s right to information under this subsection is personal to the general partner and enforceable under Section 901(a). These rights are in addition to whatever discovery rights a party has in a civil suit.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       – Codifying the information rights of former owners began with RUPA (1997) § 403(b). Access is limited and subject to conditions, most of which are drawn from Section 304 (pertaining to the information rights of limited partners).
       See also
    Subsection (i) (providing information rights to the legal representative of a deceased general partner); Section 704 (providing additional information rights to the legal representative of the deceased partner).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)(1)
       </b>
       – A person dissociated as a general partner has information rights in that capacity only as to the period during which the person was a general partner. To the extent that further information is accessible under Section 704(2) (providing access to the legal representative of a deceased partner’s estate), that access is limited both in purpose (“for purposes of settling the estate”) and in scope (“the rights of a current limited partner under Section 304”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)(2)
       </b>
       – A duty of good faith is needed here, because a person claiming access under this subsection is no longer a general partner and no longer subject to a general partner’s duties and obligations under Section 409. Section 605(a)(2) (dissociation as a partner terminates duty of good faith as to subsequent events).
       But see id
    ., cmt (noting that the common law implied covenant will continue to be relevant if the partnership agreement provides continuing rights and obligations for a person dissociated as a general partner).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the context of Subsection (e)(2), “good faith” is properly understood to mean an honest belief that the request is made for a proper purpose.
       Associated Indem. Corp. v. CAT Contracting, Inc.
    , 964 S.W.2d 276, 285 (Tex. 1998) (holding that “‘good faith’ in the surety agreement before us refers to conduct which is honest in fact, free of improper motive or wilful ignorance of the facts at hand”);
       Andrews v. Bible, 812 S.W.2d 284, 288 (Tenn. 1991) (describing “subjective good faith” as “[a] pure heart but an empty head”) (quoting
       <i>
        Whittington v. Ohio River Co
       </i>
       ., 115 F.R.D. 201, 209 (E.D.Ky.1987)). Willful ignorance includes being an ostrich. “While ‘honesty’ may require no more than a pure heart, it is questionable that a pure heart can co-exist with closed eyes. It is not honest to close one's eyes so as to maintain an empty head.”

       UPA (1914) § (3)(1) (“A person has ‘knowledge’ of a fact within the meaning of this act not only when he has actual knowledge thereof, but also when he has knowledge of such other facts as in the circumstances shows bad faith.”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)(3)
       </b>
       – Applying the limited partner standard Section 304(b) to a person dissociated as a general partner makes sense, because the person has no further management role. Theoretically, an even stricter standard might apply, because limited partners have at least some governance role. However, this act already has several different standards applicable to information rights.
    See
    Sections 304(b) (limited partner), Section 304(e) (person dissociated as a limited partner), 407(b), (c)(2) (general partner), 407(e) (person dissociated as a general partner). This act applies Section 304(b) to a person dissociated as a general partner to avoid having to create another standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (h)
       </b>
       – Some old cases involved conflicts over whether a shareholder could exercise inspection rights through another person.
       White v. Coeur D'Alene Big Creek Mining Co
    ., 55 P.2d 720, 723 (Idaho 1936) (stating that “[t]he refusal to permit respondent [shareholder] to appoint his own attorney or agent to make the examination [of the corporation’s books] was in effect a denial of his right” of inspection);
       <i>
        State v. Monida &amp; Yellowstone Stage Co
       </i>
       ., 124 N.W. 971, 972 (Minn. 1910) (upholding a trial court’s mandamus order, “which shall provide that [the shareholder complainant], or such attorney or agent as he may select, … shall be allowed to inspect the books, records, and papers of the defendant [corporation]”). In light of that history, for the avoidance of doubt, this subsection expressly authorizes taking action through an agent. No negative inference should be drawn about using agents to take other action under this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (i)
       </b>
       – This section provides no information rights to a person as transferee. Transferee status brings only the very limited information rights stated in Section 702(c). However, a transferee that is a person dissociated as a limited partner has rights in the latter capacity under Subsection (e).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (j)
       </b>
       – This subsection provides fallback protection for gaps in the partnership agreement. For example, the general partners may protect trade secrets from disclosure and prohibit various misuses of confidential information even if the partnership agreement omits to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strictly speaking, the reference to “ordinary course” is unnecessary.
       See
    Section 406(a) (providing generally that “any matter relating to the activities and affairs of the partnership is decided exclusively” by the general partners). The phrase is included merely for the avoidance of doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The limited partnership bears the burden of proving the reasonableness of any restriction imposed under this subsection. In determining whether a restriction is reasonable, a court might consider: (i) the danger or other problem the restriction seeks to avoid; (ii) the purpose for which the information is sought; and (iii) whether, in light of both the problem and the purpose, the restriction is reasonably tailored.
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of persuasion under this subsection contrasts with the burden of persuasion under Section 105(c)(9) (prohibiting unreasonable limitations on the information rights provided by this section). Under that paragraph, as a matter of ordinary procedural law the burden is on the person making the claim.

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsections (a) and (b)
       </b>
       – These subsections apply only to general partners. A limited partnership’s obligation, if any, to reimburse or indemnify others (
    e.g.
    , employees, independent contractors, other agents) is a question for other law, including the law of agency, contract and restitution. The fact a person has dissociated as a partner does not affect any obligations incurred by the partnership under these subsections for conduct occurring before the dissociation.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the extent a partnership agreement modifies or displaces the default rules stated in Sections 406 and 409, the agreement should also address these sections. For example, if the partnership agreement establishes a duty of ordinary care (modifying Section 409(c)), the agreement should specify which level of care is necessary to satisfy Subsections (a) and (b). It is not necessary that the levels of care be the same, only that the partnership agreement make the situation clear and thereby avoid difficult issues of interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – The reimbursement obligation stated here is a default rule and roughly parallels a rule of agency law. RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY § 8.14(2)(a) (2006) (stating that “[a] principal has a duty to indemnify an agent … when the agent makes a payment (i) within the scope of the agent's actual authority, or (ii) that is beneficial to the principal, unless the agent acts officiously in making the payment”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – This subsection provides for indemnification but only as a default rule. Subject only to Section 105(c)(8), the partnership agreement can relax these preconditions substantially. The agreement can also impose stricter preconditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule’s eligibility requirements correspond to the default rules on management duties, which is appropriate because otherwise the statutory default rule on indemnification could undercut or even vitiate the statutory default rules on duty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although referring broadly to any “person,” this subsection is actually limited to present and former general partners. The indemnification obligation applies to only to a “debt, obligation, or other liability incurred by the person by reason of the person’s former or present capacity as a general partner.” Thus, by its terms this subsection does not apply to a person in the capacity of an officer, manager, CEO, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the partnership agreement may mandate indemnification to officers, managers, employees, and other persons providing services to or acting for the limited partnership. Within the limitations stated in Section 105(c)(8), a limited partnership agreement may obligate a limited partnership to indemnify a person even when the person has breached a managerial duty or the partnership agreement itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       – This subsection authorizes but does not require a limited partnership to provide advances to cover expenses.
    Cf. Majkowski v. American Imaging Mgmt. Servs., LLC
    , 913 A.2d 572, 589 (Del. Ch. 2006) (“Because rights to indemnification and advancement differ in important ways, our courts have refused to recognize claims for advancement not granted in specific language clearly suggesting such rights.”). The phrase “hold harmless” likewise does not encompass advances.
       <i>
        Id
       </i>
       . The authorization applies only to those persons eligible for indemnification under Subsection (b), but the partnership agreement certainly can authorize a broader scope and even make advances obligatory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reference to “ordinary course” pertains to Section 406(a) (stating that “any matter relating to the activities and affairs of the partnership is decided exclusively by the general partner or, if there is more than one general partner, by a majority of the general partners.”)
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       – This subsection’s language is very broad and authorizes a limited partnership to purchase insurance to cover,
    e.g
    ., a general partner’s intentional misconduct. It is unlikely that such insurance would be available. This authorization comes from the act, not the partnership agreement, and therefore is not subject to restrictions stated in Section 105(c)(8) (precluding the partnership agreement from “reliev[ing] or exonerat[ing] a person from liability for conduct involving bad faith, willful or intentional misconduct, or knowing violation of law”).

      <p>
       ULPA (2001) derived this section from UPA (1997) § 404. The 2011 and 2013 Harmonization amendments made one major substantive change; they “un-cabined” fiduciary duty. UPA (1997) § 404 had deviated substantially from UPA (1914) by purporting to codify all fiduciary duties owed by partners. This approach had a number of problems. Most notably, the exhaustive list of fiduciary duties left no room for the fiduciary duty owed by partners to each other –
    i.e
    ., “the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive.”
       <i>
        Meinhard v. Salmon
       </i>
       , 164 N.E. 545, 546 (N.Y. 1928). Although UPA (1997) § 404(b) purported to state “[a] partner’s duty of loyalty to the partnership
       <i>
        and the other partners
       </i>
       ” (emphasis added), the three listed duties each protected the partnership and not the partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2011 and 2013 Harmonization amendments “un-cabined” fiduciary duty in both partnership acts, thereby harmonizing them to ULLCA (2006). As harmonized, this section states some of the core aspects of the fiduciary duty of loyalty, provides a duty of care, and incorporates the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing. The duties stated in this section are subject to the limited partnership agreement, but Section 105(c) and (d) contain important limitations on the power of the partnership agreement to affect fiduciary and other duties and the obligation of good faith and fair dealing.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the effect of dissociation on a person’s duties under this section, see Sections 602(a)(2) (limited partners) and 605(a)(2) (general partners).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – This subsection recognizes two core managerial duties but, unlike UPA (1997) and ULPA (2001), does not purport to be exhaustive. For example, many cases characterize a manager’s duty to disclose as a fiduciary duty.
       E.g., Lonergan v. EPE Holdings, LLC,
    5 A.3d 1008, 1023 (Del. Ch. 2010) (stating that “in the limited partnership context, absent contractual modification, a general partner owes fiduciary duties that include a duty of full disclosure”) (quotation marks and citation omitted);
       <i>
        Exxon Corp. v. Burglin
       </i>
       , 4 F.3d 1294, 1298 (5th Cir. 1993) (“Under Alaska law, a general partner stands in a fiduciary relationship with the limited partnership and thereby owes ‘a fiduciary duty ... to disclose information concerning partnership affairs.’”) (quoting
       <i>
        Parker v. Northern Mixing Co
       </i>
       ., 756 P.2d 881, 894 (Alaska 1988)).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – This subsection states three core aspects of the fiduciary duty of loyalty: (i) not “usurping” partnership opportunities or otherwise wrongly benefiting from the limited partnership’s operations or property; (ii) avoiding conflict of interests in dealing with the limited partnership (whether directly or on behalf of another); and (iii) refraining from competing with the limited partnership. Essentially the same duties exist in agency law and under the law of all types of business organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The duties apply beginning with “the conduct of the partnership’s activities and affairs,” which by definition cannot exist before the partnership does; thus the stated duties do not apply to pre-formation activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The duties stated in this subsection comprise a default rule. Under Section 105(d)(3)(A): “If not manifestly unreasonable, the partnership agreement may … alter or eliminate the aspects of the duty of loyalty stated in Section 409(b).”
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)
       </b>
       – The phrase “hold as trustee” dates back to UPA (1914) § 21 and reflects the availability of disgorgement remedies, such as a constructive trust. In contrast to an actual trustee, a person subject to this duty does not: (i) face the special obstacles to consent characteristic of trust law; or (ii) enjoy protection for decisions taken in reliance on the governing instrument and other sources of information.
    Cf
    . Uniform Statutory Trust Entity Act (2009) (Last Amended 2013) § 506 (“A trustee [of a statutory trust]… is not liable to the trust or to a beneficial owner for breach of any duty,
       <i>
        including a fiduciary duty
       </i>
       , to the extent the breach results from reasonable reliance on: (1) a term of the governing instrument; (2) a record of the statutory trust; or (3) an opinion, report, or statement of another person that the person to which the opinion, report, or statement is made or delivered reasonably believes is within the other person’s professional or expert competence and is made or delivered to the trustee.”) (emphasis added).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)(A)
       </b>
       – This provision is consistent with a basic principle of agency law – namely, that an agent may not benefit at all from the performance of the agency unless the principal consents.
       RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY § 8.06, cmt. c. (2006). Typically, however, the limited partnership agreement legitimizes particular benefits –
    e.g
    ., a management fee paid to a general partner in addition to that partner’s share of distributions. Also, an agreed allocation of distributions takes those benefits outside the reach of this provision.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)(B)
       </b>
       – For the expansive meaning of “property,” see Section 102(17). The term includes confidential information.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)(C)
       </b>
       – This act does not specify what constitutes “a partnership opportunity,” but ample case law exists.
       See, e.g., In re Monetary Grp.,
    159 B.R. 964 (M.D. Fla. 1990) (discussing the usurpation of a limited partnership opportunity”),
       <i>
        aff'd in part, rev'd in part
       </i>
       ,
       2 F.3d 1098 (11th Cir. 1993);
       <i>
        Lichtyger v. Franchard Corp.
       </i>
       , 18 N.Y.2d 528, 223 N.E.2d 869, 873 (1966) (“There is no basis or warrant for distinguishing the fiduciary relationship of corporate director and shareholder from that of general partner and limited partner.”)
      </p>
      <p>
       In the context of winding up, the scope of partnership opportunities inevitably narrows.
      </p>
      <p>
       In most, if not all, situations, usurping a partnership opportunity also breaches the duty not to compete, Paragraph (b)(3), but not
       vice versa
    .
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(2)
       </b>
       – In this context, the phrase “adverse interest” is a term of art, meaning “to be on the other side of the table” in some dealing with the limited partnership. Absent informed consent by the limited partnership, this duty is breached by the mere existence of the conflict of interest; the limited partnership need not prove that the outcome of the dealing was adverse to the partnership.
       But see
    Subsection (g) (permitting the defense of fairness).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(3)
       </b>
       – Although competition is often thought of in terms of potential customers, this duty applies equally to competition for resources, including employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       – This act no longer refers to the duty of care as a fiduciary duty, because: (i) the duty of care applies in many non-fiduciary situations; and (ii) breach of the duty of care is remediable only in damages while breach of a fiduciary duty gives rise also to equitable remedies, including disgorgement, constructive trust, and rescission.
      </p>
      <p>
       The change in label is consistent with the
       RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY § 8.02 (2006), which refers to the agent’s “fiduciary duty” to act loyally, but eschews the word “fiduciary” when stating the agent’s duties of “care, competence, and diligence.”
       Id.
    § 8.08. However, the label change is merely semantics; no change is the law is intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement can raise the standard of care, or subject to Sections 105(c)(8) and (d)(2)(C), lower it. A person’s practical exposure for breaching the duty of care involves not only the standard of care but also any partnership agreement provision that: (i) exonerates the person from liability for breach of the duty of care, Section 105(c)(8); or (ii) entitles the person to indemnification despite such breach, Section 408(b), comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       – This subsection refers to the “
    contractual
    obligation of good faith and fair dealing” (emphasis added) and thereby invokes the implied obligation that exists in every contract.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       RESTATEMENT (SECOND) CONTRACTS § 205 (1981) (“Every contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement.”). The adjective (“contractual”) should help avoid decisions like
       <i>
        Phelps v. Frampton
       </i>
       , 2007 MT 263, 339 Mont. 330, 342-43, 170 P.3d 474, 483 (2007) (holding that Montana’s version of UPA (1997) creates a statutory obligation of good faith and fair dealing separate from the implied contractual covenant).
      </p>
      <p>
       At first glance, it may seem strange to apply a contractual obligation to statutory duties and rights –
       i.e
    ., duties and rights “under this [act].” However, for the most part those duties and rights apply to relationships
       <i>
        inter se
       </i>
       the partners and the limited partnership and function only to the extent not displaced by the partnership agreement. Those statutory default rules are thus intended to function like a contract; applying the contractual notion of good faith and fair dealing therefore makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The contractual obligation of “good faith” has nothing to do with the corporate concept of good faith that for years bedeviled courts and attorneys trying to understand: (i) Delaware’s famous corporate law exoneration provision; and (ii) that provision’s exception “for acts or omissions not in good faith.”
       DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 8, § 102(b)(7) (2012). In that context, good faith is an aspect of the duty of loyalty.
       See Stone ex rel. AmSouth Bancorporation v. Ritter
    , 911 A.2d 362, 369-70 (Del. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing has nothing to do with the “utmost good faith” sometimes used to describe the fiduciary duties that owners of closely held businesses owe each other.
       See, e.g., Meinhard v. Salmon
    , 249 N.Y. 458, 477, 164 N.E. 545, 551 (1928) (“[W]here parties engage in a joint enterprise each owes to the other the duty of the utmost good faith in all that relates to their common venture. Within its scope they stand in a fiduciary relationship.”);
       <i>
        Donahue v. Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, Inc
       </i>
       ., 367 Mass. 578, 593, 328 N.E.2d 505, 515 (1975) (“[S]tockholders in the close corporation owe one another substantially the same fiduciary duty in the operation of the enterprise that partners owe to one another. In our previous decisions, we have defined the standard of duty owed by partners to one another as the utmost good faith and loyalty.”) (footnotes omitted) (citations omitted) (internal quotations omitted).
      </p>
      <p>
       To the contrary, the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing is not a fiduciary duty, does not command altruism or self-abnegation, and does not prevent a general partner from acting in the general partner’s own self-interest:
      </p>
      
      <p>
       “Fair dealing” is not akin to the fair process component of entire fairness, ., whether the fiduciary acted fairly when engaging in the challenged transaction as measured by duties of loyalty and care … It is rather a commitment to deal “fairly” in the sense of consistently with the terms of the parties' agreement and its purpose. Likewise “good faith” does not envision loyalty to the contractual counterparty, but rather faithfulness to the scope, purpose, and terms of the parties' contract. Both necessarily turn on the contract itself and what the parties would have agreed upon had the issue arisen when they were bargaining originally. i.e

      </p>
      <p>
       Courts should not use the contractual obligation to change
       ex post facto
    the parties’ or this act’s allocation of risk and power. To the contrary, the obligation should be used only to protect agreed-upon arrangements from conduct that is manifestly beyond what a reasonable person could have contemplated when the arrangements were made.
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement or this act may grant discretion to a general partner, and the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing is especially salient when discretion is at issue. However, a general partner may properly exercise discretion even though another partner (whether general or limited) suffers as a consequence. Conduct does not violate the obligation of good faith and fair dealing merely because that conduct substantially prejudices a party. Indeed, parties allocate risk precisely because prejudice may occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       The exercise of discretion constitutes a breach of the obligation of good faith and fair dealing only when the party claiming breach shows that the conduct has no honestly-held purpose that legitimately comports with the parties’ agreed-upon arrangements:
      </p>
      
      <p>
       An implied covenant claim . . . looks to the past. It is not a free-floating duty unattached to the underlying legal documents. It does not ask what duty the law should impose on the parties given their relationship at the time of the wrong, but rather what the parties would have agreed to themselves had they considered the issue in their original bargaining positions at the time of contracting.

      <p>
       As to the power of the partnership agreement to affect the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing, see Section 105(c)(7) (prohibiting elimination but allowing the agreement to “prescribe the standards, if not manifestly unreasonable, by which the performance of the obligation is to be measured”).

        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       – A general partner in a limited partnership has at least two different roles: (i) as a party to the limited partnership agreement, with rights and obligations under that agreement; and (ii) as manager or co-manager of the enterprise. This provision pertains to the first role. A general partner’s exercise of rights under the partnership agreement is subject to the obligation of good faith and fair dealing, Subsection (d), but a general partner does not breach that contractual obligation “solely because the general partner’s conduct furthers the general partner’s own interest.” In contrast, this provision is ineffective with regard to a general partner’s duties as manager or co-manager. For example, a general partner’s liability under Section 409(b)(3) (prohibiting competition) is not “solely because the general partner’s conduct furthers the general partner’s own interest.” Rather, the liability results from the breach of a specific obligation –

       This section is intentionally quite broad, encompassing past, present, and promised benefits. Comparable language exists in most, if not all, limited partnership statutes, and case law recognizes the intended broadness of this approach.
       See, e.g., Rival 1981-IV Drilling Program, Ltd. v. Guar. Bank &amp; Trust,
    732 P.2d 1233, 1234 (Colo. Ct. App. 1986) (letter of credit as contribution);

      </p>
      <p>
       This act does not contain a statute of frauds specifically applicable to promised
       contributions. Generally applicable statutes of fraud might apply, however. For example, a
       promise to contribute land to the limited partnership would be subject to the statute of frauds
       pertaining to land transfers.
       See Gunsorek v. Hearland Bank,
    707 N.E.2d 557, 564 (Ohio 1997)
       (holding that where terms of oral partnership agreement required limited partner to contribute
       real property, statute of frauds barred enforceability of the agreement). Likewise, a promise that
       by its terms requires performance that extends beyond one year from the making of the contract
       would be subject to the one-year provision of the statute of frauds.

       – Under common law principles of impracticability, an individual’s death or incapacity will sometimes discharge a duty to render performance. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS §§ 261 (Discharge by Supervening Impracticability), 262 (Death or Incapacity of
       Person Necessary For Performance). (1981). This subsection overrides those principles.
       Moreover, the reference to “perform personally” is not limited to individuals but rather may refer
       to any legal person (including an entity) that has a non-delegable duty.

      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: In order to become a partner, a person promises to contribute to the limited
       partnership various assets which the partnership agreement values at $150,000. In return
       for the person’s promise, and in light of the agreed value, the limited partnership admits
       the person as a partner with a right to receive 25% of the limited partnership’s
       distributions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The promised assets are subject to a security agreement, but the partner promises
       to contribute them “free and clear.” Before the partner can contribute the assets, the
       secured party forecloses on the security interest and sells the assets at a public sale for
       $75,000. Even if the $75,000 reflects the actual fair market value of the assets, under this
       subsection the limited partnership has a claim against the partner for “money equal to the
       value . . . of the part of the contribution which has not been made” –
    i.e.,
    $150,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Same facts as the previous example, except that the public sale brings
       $225,000. The limited partnership is neither obliged to invoke this subsection nor limited
       to the $150,000 valuation. The limited partnership may instead sue for breach of the
       promise to make the contribution, asserting the $225,000 figure as evidence of the actual
       loss suffered as a result of the breach.

      <p>
       Past uniform unincorporated entity acts and many current limited partnership acts provide default rules for allocation of profits, and UPA (1997) even provided a default structure for maintaining capital accounts. For the following reasons, this act, incorporating changes made by the Harmonization Project, provides a default rule only for rights to share in distributions:
      </p>
      <p>
       • Capital accounts are maintained for one purpose, to determine how distributions will be made to partners. The rules for maintenance of capital accounts can be very complex. Generally, however, profits increase capital account balances (and increase the amounts that will be distributed to the partners) and losses reduce capital account balances (and reduce the amounts that will be distributed to the partners). If the statute has a simple default rule for how distributions are to be made to the partners, providing an additional set of default profit and loss allocation provisions and capital account rules will be, at best, duplicative and, at worse, inconsistent with the distribution rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Some argue that capital account rules and profit and loss allocation provisions are necessary to comply with tax requirements. Tax income or loss is allocated to partners according to the partners' economic interests in the partnership, and these interests are based on distributions that would be made to partners on liquidation of the partnership. By including default distribution provisions, the act includes the information necessary to make these tax determinations. To the extent the tax law allows partners to make further tax elections or satisfy alternative safe harbors, the partners may look to the tax law for guidance and include necessary provisions in their agreements.
      </p>

       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>

      </h4>
      <p>
       Both this section and Section 505 were derived essentially from the Model Business Corporation Act section 6.40. Both sections are necessary and appropriate because a limited partnership provides its limited partners a corporate-like liability shield and a limited liability limited partnership provides the shield to general partners as well. With the exception noted in the comment to Subsection (a)(2), the provisions of this section are non-waivable. Section 105(c)(18).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Distribution” does not include “amounts constituting reasonable compensation for present or past service or payments made in the ordinary course of business under a bona fide retirement plan or other bona fide benefits program.” Section 102(4)(B).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – Insolvency is a fundamental issue under this section, and this subsection provides two tests of insolvency. The tests are disjunctive; a distribution violates this section if after the distribution the limited partnership fails either of the tests. The subsection applies both to interim and liquidating distributions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solvency is also a fundamental issue under bankruptcy and fraudulent transfer law, which provide their own respective definitions of the concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       – The reference to “preferential rights upon dissolution and winding up” is a default rule, because removing this protection for preferred partners or transferees is an
       inter se
    matter.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 105(d)(1)(B). The rest of the section is not subject to change in the partnership agreement. Section 105(c)(18).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – This subsection states a standard of ordinary care, in contrast with the generally-applicable standard stated in Section 409(c) (gross negligence).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(2)
       </b>
       – This alternative valuation provision is likely to be both useful and fair when the limited partnership has appreciated assets but for accounting purposes these assets are valued at book value less depreciation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       – This subsection provides three alternative rules for determining the point(s) in time of as which to apply the Subsection (a) solvency tests. The timing depends on which of three categories encompasses a distribution: (i) a distribution in the nature of a redemption (regardless of whether the distribution includes a distribution of indebtedness); (ii) any distribution of indebtedness other than a distribution in the nature of a redemption; and (iii) any distribution that involves neither a redemption nor a distribution of indebtedness. A requirement for additional solvency testing pertaining to distributions of indebtedness appears in Subsection (e).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(1)
       </b>
       – Section 102(4)(A) encompasses distributions in the nature of a redemption.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(1)(A) and (B)
       </b>
       – Under Subparagraph (A), any beginning of payment activity triggers to the rule and sets the date as of when to apply the solvency tests. Under Subparagraph (B), the limited partnership’s complete acquisition of the rights is necessary to trigger the rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(2)
       </b>
       – This provision states the general rule for distributions that are in the form of debt and which are not connected with a redemption.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(3)
       </b>
       – This provision states alternative rules for all distribution of money or property
       (i.e
    ., not debt). The measuring date depends on the length of time between the authorization and payment of the distribution.
      </p>
      <p>

        Subsection (d)
       </b>

    Subsection (d),
       <i>

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       – This subsection contains two rules pertaining to indebtedness issued as part of a distribution and the solvency tests of Subsection (a). The first sentence states the sensible rule that indebtedness that is essentially subordinated to the solvency requirement —
    i.e.,
    not payable if making payment would transgress that requirement — is not counted in determining liabilities for purposes of the solvency tests. The second sentence applies the solvency tests to each payment of principal and interest on any indebtedness issued as a distribution, in addition to
       any previous testing required by Subsection (c)(1)(A) or (c)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A limited partnership and one of its partners agree that the limited partnership will buy out the partner’s entire ownership interest in the partnership in return
       for a promissory note from the partnership, payable in installments. Under the
       redemption agreement, the partner yields up all its interests and rights on January 15 and
       the partnership signs and delivers the note to the dissociated partner on February 15.
       Under the note, payment of interest is due monthly beginning March 15, with a balloon
       payment of the principal due December 30.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Subsection (c)(1)(B), the solvency tests are applied as of January 15.
       Under Subsection (e), the solvency tests are again applied on the March 15, April 15, etc.,
       and again on December 30.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f)
       </b>
       – The cited sections provide methods for extinguishing or limiting the debts of a limited partnership that is winding up its affairs and activities and thus any debt affected by any of the cited sections is irrelevant for purposes of solvency testing.

      <p>
       This section and Section 504 were derived essentially from Model Business Corporation Act section 6.40. As with Section 504, this section is appropriate and necessary due to the liability shield of a limited partnership. The provisions of this section are non-waivable. Section 105(c)(18).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section contemplates two categories of liability: liability of those who have authorized improper distributions, Subsection (a), and the liability of those who have received improper distributions, Subsection (c). Liability that has accrued under this section is not affected by a person subsequently ceasing to be a partner or transferee.
      </p>
      <p>
       The liability is to the entity, not to the creditors of an insolvent entity.
       See Hullett v.Cousin,
       63 P.3d 1029, 1036 (Ariz. 2003) (holding that where limited partners had no intent to
       defraud creditors, and had no reason to know the partnership was insolvent at the time, return of
       the partners’ contributions was not an improper distribution and could not be used to satisfy creditor’s claim against the partnership). However, some cases accord a creditor standing to
       invoke the statute.
       <i>
        See, e.g., Henkels &amp; McCoy, Inc. v. Adochio,
       </i>
       906 F. Supp. 244, 249–50 (E.D.Pa. 1995), aff’d, 138 F.3d 491, 503–04 (3d Cir. 1998) (holding limited partners liable to creditor where general partner knew or should have known the distributions were in violation of partnership agreement).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not preclude or interfere with claims for fraudulent transfer.
       See
       Subsection (d), cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – The liability is not strict liability but rather attaches only to the extent a decision maker has failed to comply with the duties stated in Section 409. To the extent those duties have been permissibly revised by the partnership agreement, the revised standards apply to this subsection.
       See also
    Section 504(b)(1) (permitting reasonable reliance on specified financial information).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – Actual knowledge is necessary to impose liability. Reason to know does not suffice.
       Compare
    Subsection (b),
       <i>
        with
       </i>
       Section 103(a)-(b).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsections (b) and (c)(2)
       </b>
       – Liability could apply to a person who receives a distribution under a charging order, but only if the person meets the knowledge requirement. That situation is very unlikely unless the person with the charging order is also a general partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       – When the distribution is in the form of indebtedness, the distribution may occur on several different dates.
       See
    Section 504(e), cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       This statute of limitations applies only to actions “under this section” and does not affect claims under other applicable law, which most often is fraudulent transfer law. For a different approach, see
       DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 6, § 18-607(c) (West 2013) (applying a 3-year statute of imitations to claims “under this chapter or other applicable law”); N.Y. PTR. LAW § 121-607 (c) (same).
       But see, e.g., In re The Heritage Org., LLC,
    413 BR 438, 461 (Bankr. ND Tex. 2009) (invoking the Texas Uninform Fraudulent Act [TUFTA] to recover distributions made by a Delaware LLC headquartered in Texas; rejecting
       DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 6, § 18-607(c) on choice of law grounds; stating that “the Delaware legislature cannot limit the reach of TUFTA”).

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – This provision states a default rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – This subsection states default rules, which the partnership agreement may vary. However, it would be nonsensical to vary some of the rules –
    e.g.,
    to provide that the death of a partner who is an individual does not cause the individual’s dissociation as a partner, Subsection (b)(6), or that an entity remains a partner even after the existence of the entity has terminated, Subsection (b)(9).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)
       </b>
       – The partnership agreement may vary this provision, even to the extent of eliminating a person’s power to dissociate as a limited partner. Section 105(c)(11) prohibits the limited partnership agreement from eliminating the power to dissociate of a person as a
    general
    partner, but neither Section 105(c) nor (d) preserve as mandatory the power of a person to dissociate as a
       <i>
        limited
       </i>
       partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(4)(B)
       </b>
       – This provision permits expulsion when a limited partner no longer has any “skin in the game.” Under this subparagraph (unless the limited partnership agreement provides otherwise), a limited partner’s transferee can protect itself from the vulnerability of “bare naked transferee” status by obligating the partner/transferor to retain a 1% interest and exercise the partner’s contract and governance rights (including the right to bring a derivative suit) to protect the transferee’s interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(5)
       </b>
       – By its terms, this provision does not permit a partner to bring a direct action for expulsion even if the partner could establish standing under Section 901(b). Dealing with a misbehaving limited partner is a management duty, properly reserved to the general partners.
    Cf
    . Section 603(5) (permitting an “application by the limited partnership or a partner in a direct action under Section 901” for a judicial order expelling a general partner).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the partnership agreement can revise or eliminate the possibility of judicial expulsion, doing so requires careful planning.
    Cf. Huatuco v. Satellite Healthcare,
    CV 8465-VCG, 2013 WL 6460898, at *1, n.2 (Del. Ch. Dec. 9, 2013) (stating that “the right to judicial dissolution is a default right which the parties may eschew by contract” while reserving the question of “[w]hether the parties may, by contract, divest this Court of its authority to order a dissolution in all circumstances, even where it appears manifest that equity so requires—leaving, for instance, irreconcilable members locked away together forever like some alternative entity version of Sartre's Huis Clos”).
      </p>
      <p>
       For examples of conduct warranting an expulsion order in various contexts, see
    All Saints Univ. of Med. Aruba v. Chilana,
    A-2628-09T1, 2012 WL 6652510 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. Dec. 24, 2012) (discussing a pattern of conduct);
       <i>
        Sherwood Park Bus. Ctr., L.L.C. v. Taggart,
       </i>
       323 P.3d 551, 561 (Or. Ct. App. 2014) (upholding expulsion of a member who “had stolen a large amount of money from [the limited liability company], had intentionally failed to provide financial information, and had made himself unavailable to carry on the business”);
       <i>
        CCD, L.C. v. Millsap,
       </i>
       116 P.3d 366, 373 (Utah 2005) (holding that a member’s “misappropriat[ion of] trust account funds totaling at least $11,540.06 for his personal use” warranted expulsion, where the member’s “misconduct continued the pattern of behavior that [had previously] resulted in losses to the company of $625,000[, where the new misconduct] . . . took place after [the member’s] prior wrongdoing had been discovered and after [the limited liability company] had assented to permit [the member] to atone for his misdeeds by fulfilling the terms of the amended operating agreement”).
      </p>
      <p>
       For an analysis that helps distinguish Paragraph (5)(C) from Paragraphs (5)(A) and (B), see
    All Saints Univ. of Med. Aruba v. Chilana,
    A-2628-09T1, 2012 WL 6652510, at *15 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. Dec. 24, 2012) (interpreting predecessor law and noting that the “not reasonably practicable standard” does not require a showing of wrongful conduct).
       <i>
        Cf. Dunnagan v. Watson,
       </i>
       204 S.W.3d 30, 40 (Tex. Ct. App. 2006) (same issue in the context of dissolution). Where grounds exist for both dissociation and dissolution, a court has the discretion to choose between the alternatives.
       <i>
        Robertson v. Jacobs Cattle Co.,
       </i>
       830 N.W.2d 191, 201–02 (Neb. 2013) (discussing analogous provisions of UPA (1997)). “[T]here is no textual basis for imposing a higher burden of proof for dissociation than dissolution.”
       <i>
        Brennan v. Brennan Assocs.,
       </i>
       977 A.2d 107, 121 (Conn. 2009) (general partnership).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(7) and (8)
       </b>
       – A change in trustee or personal representative does not cause dissociation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(9)
       </b>
       – This provision is the entity analog to Subsection (b)(6) (death of an individual). Although in theory the partnership agreement could change this rule, doing so would be nonsensical.
    See
    Section 803(a), cmt. (noting that a terminated limited liability company cannot rescind its dissolution because “a ‘dead’ entity lacks both the capacity and power to bring itself back from the dead”).
       <i>
        See also
       </i>
       Subsection (b)(14).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(10)(A)
       </b>
       – If a limited partnership disappears as part of a merger, no person can continue as a partner of the limited partnership. When the merger takes effect, the partners of the disappearing entity are perforce dissociated. Depending on the plan of merger, those persons may become partners of a surviving limited partnership. In those circumstances, the merger will have dissociated them from one limited partnership and admitted them into partnership in the surviving entity.
    See
    Section 301(b)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(10)(B)
       </b>
       – It is possible for a plan of merger to “shuffle the equity” of the surviving entity, even to the extent of “taking out” some or all of the owners of the surviving entity. A reverse triangular merger involving a limited partnership as the surviving entity would dissociate all the pre-merger partners of the partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(12)
       </b>
       – By definition, a limited partnership that converts ceases to be a limited partnership. Thus, when the plan of conversion takes effect, all the partners of the converted entity are dissociated from that entity. In many cases, those persons will all be owners of the converted entity. In some cases, the conversion will “shuffle the equity” and “take out” some of the partners of the converting limited partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(13)
       </b>
       – Domestication does not by itself dissociate a partner, because the domesticated entity remains both a limited partnership and “the same entity without interruption as the domesticating company.” Section 1156(a)(1)(B). However, an “equity shuffle” could dissociate a partner.

        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – This provision makes no reference to power-to-bind matters, because the act provides that a limited partner
       qua
    limited partner has no power to bind the limited partnership. Section 302(a).

       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       – This provision does not determine the effect of a person’s dissociation as a limited partner on the person’s future obligations or rights under the partnership agreement. Some contractual obligations typically extend beyond dissociation –
       e.g.,
    buyout arrangements. To the extent provisions of the partnership agreement continue to apply, the common law obligation of good faith continues to apply as well.

       <b>
        Subsection (a)(3)

      <p>
       This section mostly states default rules, which the limited partnership agreement may vary. However, it would make no sense to vary some of the rules –
       e.g
    ., to provide that death does
       <i>
        not
       </i>
       cause an individual’s dissociation, Paragraph (6)(A), or that person (other than an individual) remains a general partner even
       <i>
        after
       </i>
       “the existence of the person terminates.” Paragraph (10).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (1)
       </b>
       – Limited partnership agreements often require notice of dissociation to be in writing and to specify the effective date of the dissociation. The agreement cannot eliminate the power of a general partner to dissociate by express will, Section 105(c)(11) but can eliminate the right and thereby make the dissociation wrongful.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (3)
       </b>
       – Many partnership agreements provide for “no cause” expulsion, and courts considering such provisions have taken somewhat different approaches.
       Compare Gelder
       Med. Grp. v. Webber,
    41 N.Y.2d 680, 684, 363 N.E.2d 573, 576 (1977)
       <i>
        with Winston &amp; Strawn v. Nosal,
       </i>

       Section 409(d) and cmt. (stating and explaining the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (4)(B)
       </b>
       – This paragraph permits expulsion when a general partner no longer has any “skin in the game.” Under this paragraph (unless the partnership agreement provides otherwise), a general partner’s transferee can protect itself from the vulnerability of “bare naked assignee” status, Section 107(b), cmt., by obligating the general partner/transferor to retain a 1% interest and exercise the partner’s governance rights (including the right to bring a derivative suit) to protect the transferee’s interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (5)
       </b>
       – The reference to “a direct action under Section 901” reflects the “separate entity” nature of a limited partnership. Section 901 limits a partner’s standing to bring a direct action to circumstances in which the partner can “plead and prove an actual or threatened injury that is not solely the result of an injury suffered or threatened to be suffered by the limited partnership.”
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: General Partner Alpha breaches the limited partnership agreement by purporting to oust General Partner Beta from General Partner Beta’s role in managing the limited partnership. General Partner Beta has a direct claim against General Partner Alpha, not only for breach of contract, but also for expulsion under Paragraph 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: General Partner Alpha breaches the limited partnership agreement (and also Section 409(c)) through grossly negligent conduct which harms the profitability of the limited partnership. Depending on the terms of the limited partnership agreement and the allocation of power among the partners, General Partner Beta may be able to cause the limited partnership to invoke Paragraph 5 and seek General Partner Alpha’s expulsion. But General Partner Beta has no standing individually to seek General Partner Alpha’s expulsion, except through a derivative claim. (The same is true for a claim of breach of contract.
    See
    Section 901(b), cmt.)

        Paragraph (5)(C)
       </b>
       – This provision has an analog among the causes for dissolution.

      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (6)(B) and (C)
       </b>
       – No comparable provisions appear in Section 601 (dealing with the dissociation of a limited partner), because, given the limited rights and duties of limited partners, the stated occurrences do not necessarily justify dissociation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph 7(A)
       </b>
       – This provision is subject to bankruptcy law.
       See, e.g.,
    11 U.S.C.A. § 365(e) (invalidating “ipso facto” clauses, subject to some exceptions).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraphs (8) and (9)
       </b>
       – A change in trustee or personal representative does not cause dissociation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (10)
       </b>
       – This provision is the entity analog to Paragraph (7)(A) (death of an individual). Although in theory the partnership agreement could change this rule, doing so would be nonsensical.
       See
    Section 803(a), cmt. (noting that a terminated limited partnership cannot rescind its dissolution because “a ‘dead’ entity lacks both the capacity and power to bring itself back from the dead”).
       <i>
        See also
       </i>
       Paragraph (15).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (11)(A)
       </b>
       – If a limited partnership disappears as part of a merger, no person can continue as a partner of the partnership. When the merger takes effect, the partners of the disappearing partnership are perforce dissociated. Depending on the plan of merger, those persons may become partners of a surviving limited partnership. In those circumstances, the merger will have dissociated them from one limited partnership and admitted them into partnership in the surviving limited partnership.
       See
    Section 401(b)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (11)(B)
       </b>
       – It is possible for a plan of merger to “shuffle the equity” of the surviving entity, even to the extent of “taking out” some or all of the owners of the surviving entity. A reverse triangular merger involving a limited partnership as the surviving entity would dissociate all the pre-merger partners of the limited partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (13)
       </b>
       – By definition, a limited partnership that converts ceases to be a limited partnership.
       See
    Section 1146. Thus, when the plan of conversion takes effect, all the partners of the converted entity are dissociated from that entity. In many cases, those persons will all be owners of the converted entity. In some cases, the conversion will “shuffle the equity” and “take out” some of the partners of the converting LLC.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Paragraph (14)
       </b>
       – Domestication does not by itself dissociate a partner, because the domesticated entity remains both a limited partnership and “the same entity without interruption as the domesticating company.” Section 1156(a)(1)(B). However, an “equity shuffle” could dissociate a general partner.

       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – The limited partnership agreement may not eliminate this power.
    See
    Section 105(c)(11). In this respect, a general partner in a limited partnership is analogous to a general partner in general partnership.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       UPA (1997) (Last Amended 2013) § 105(c)(9).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – This subsection list exhaustively (“only if”) the dissociations that are “wrongful,” but the list is a default rule. The limited partnership agreement can expand the list;
    e.g.,
    by making wrongful a dissociation that beaches the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In theory, the partnership agreement can provide for liquidated damages (subject to the requirements of contract law) and, in theory, can also contract or even eliminate the list of wrongful dissociations.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)
       </b>
       – The reference to “an express provision of the partnership agreement” means that a person’s dissociation as a general partner in breach of the obligation of good faith and fair dealing is not wrongful dissociation for the purposes of this section. The breach might be actionable on other grounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(2)
       </b>
       – The reference to “before the termination of the limited partnership” reflects the expectation that each general partner will shepherd the limited partnership through winding up.
    See
    Section 406(f), cmt. A person’s obligation to remain as general partner through winding up continues even if another general partner dissociates and even if that dissociation leads to the limited partnership’s premature dissolution under Section 801(3)(A).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(2)(C)
       </b>
       – This subsection refers to Section 603(7), which involves
    inter alia
    dissociation on account of bankruptcy, which in turn is subject to bankruptcy law.
       <i>
        See, e.g.,
       </i>
       11 U.S.C.A. § 365(e) (invalidating “ipso facto” clauses, subject to some exceptions).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       – A person who prematurely dissociates as a general partner risks liability for any resulting damages. For example, the limited partnership might incur substantial expenses in replacing the general partner’s expertise, reputation, or creditworthiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       In effect, this subsection equates wrongful dissociation with breach of contract. Accordingly, courts should look to contract law to determine what consequential damages are recoverable.
    See Hadley v. Baxendale,
    9 Exch. 341 (1854); RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 351 (1981);
       <i>
        see also Williams v. Hildebrand

       , 247 S.W.2d 356, 358 (Ark. 1952) (interpreting UPA (1914) § 38(2)(a)(II), pertaining to wrongful dissolution, and stating that “the measure of damages, when the partnership was to have continued for a fixed term, is the profits that the injured partner would have received”).
      </p>
      <p>
       The language “subject to Section 901” is intended to preserve the distinction between direct and derivative claims.

       <b>
        Subsection (a)(1)
       </b>
       – Once a person dissociates as a general partner, the person loses all management rights as a general partner regardless of what happens to the limited partnership. This rule contrasts with UPA (1997) (Last Amended 2011) Section 603(b)(1), which permits a dissociated general partner to participate in winding up in some circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       – This provision establishes a dividing line, separating out “matters arising and events occurring after the person’s dissociation.” If the limited partnership has continuing projects with clients, ongoing relationships with clients, or both, the dividing line requires special attention with regard to non-competition and partnership opportunities duties.
    See
    Section 409(b)(1) and (3).
      </p>
      <p>
       Disputes involving law firms have generated much of the relevant case law.
    See, e.g., Meehan v. Shaughnessy,
    404 Mass. 419, 422, 535 N.E.2d 1255, 1257 (1989);
       <i>
        Jewel v. Boxer,
       </i>
       156 Cal. App. 3d 171, 175, 203 Cal. Rptr. 13, 15 (Ct. App. 1984). To a large extent, a well-drawn partnership agreement can delineate the parties’ respective rights and responsibilities and thereby avoid problems. However, if the partnership becomes insolvent, the bankruptcy court may well scrutinize the partners’
       <i>
        inter se
       </i>
       arrangements.
       <i>
        See Geron v. Robinson &amp; Cole
       </i>
       LLP, 476 B.R. 732, 743 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (considering whether a law firm had “fraudulently transferred … assets when its partners adopted the Jewel Waiver [releasing rights recognized by
       <i>
        Jewel v. Boxer
       </i>
       ] on the eve of dissolution without consideration”).
      </p>
      <p>
       This provision does not determine the effect of a person’s dissociation as a general partner on the person’s future obligations or rights under the partnership agreement. Some contractual obligations typically extend beyond dissociation –
    e.g.,
    non-competition provisions, buyout arrangements. To the extent provisions of the partnership agreement continue to apply, the common law obligation of good faith continues to apply as well.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       409(d), cmt. (explaining that the subsection “invokes the implied obligation that exists in every contract” as a matter of common law).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(3)
       </b>
       – Both records covered by this provision have the same effect under Section 103(d) – namely, to give constructive notice that the person has dissociated as a general partner. The notice benefits the person by curtailing any further personal liability under Sections 607, 805, and 1111. The notice benefits the limited partnership by curtailing any lingering power to bind under Sections 606, 804, and 1112.
      </p>
      <p>
       The limited partnership is in any event obligated to amend its certificate of limited partnership to reflect the dissociation of a person as general partner.
    See
    Section 202(d)(2). In most circumstances, the amendment requires the signature of the person that has dissociated. Section 203(a)(5)(C). If that signature is required and the person refuses or fails to sign, the limited partnership may invoke Section 204 (Signing and Filing Pursuant to Judicial Order).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(4)
       </b>
       – As provided in Section 503(b), dissociation does not result in a distribution. In general, when a person dissociates as a general partner, the person’s rights as a general partner disappear and, subject to Section 109 (Dual Capacity), the person’s status degrades to that of a mere transferee – even when the dissociation comes in the form of expulsion.
    All Saints Univ. of Med. Aruba v. Chilana,
    A-2628-09T1, 2012 WL 6652510 at *12 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. Dec. 24, 2012). On distinguishing between a person’s rights of a general partner and as a limited partners, see Section 108(9)(C) (providing that, for any person that is both a general partner and a limited partner, the required information must state which transferable interest is owned in which capacity).
      </p>
      <p>
       Like
    most inter se
    rules in this act, this one is subject to the partnership agreement. For example, the limited partnership agreement might provide for the buyout of a person’s transferable interest in connection with the person’s dissociation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 704 provides additional information rights when an individual’s death has caused dissociation. Article 11 covers organic transactions such as mergers and conversions.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – A general partner’s obligation to safeguard trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information is incurred when the partner learns or otherwise obtains the information. This subsection preserves the obligation post-dissociation.

       A person’s dissociation as a general partner ends immediately the person’s actual authority to act for the partnership.
       See
    Section 605(a)(1). However, the person’s apparent authority may linger.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not affect a person’s power to bind a partnership in another capacity –
    e.g.,
    as an employee with actual authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – This subsection codifies and constrains the lingering apparent authority of a person dissociated as a general partner. The constraint is in the phrase “only if.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The provision applies until the limited partnership dissolves or under [Article] 11 ceases to be governed by this act. Once a limited partnership dissolves, Section 804 applies.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(1)

       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)(A)
       </b>
       – In any event, any lingering apparent authority ends two years after the dissociation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)(B)
       </b>
       – A person might have notice under Section 103(d)(1) (statement of dissociation) as well as under Section 103(b)(1) (person “ha[ving] reason to know the fact from all the facts known to the person at the time in question”).

      <p>
       To the extent a limited partnership has been a limited liability limited partnership throughout its existence, the liability rules stated in this section are moot.
       See, e.g.,
    subsection (c)(1).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       – A person’s dissociation as a general partner does not categorically preclude the person being liable as a general partner for subsequently incurred obligations of the limited partnership. If the dissociation results in dissolution, Subsection (b) applies and the person will be liable as a general partner on any partnership obligation incurred under Section 805. If the dissociation does not result in dissolution, Subsection (c) applies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “liability as a general partner for an obligation of the limited partnership” refers to liability under Section 404. As stated in Section 404(b) and (c), comments, other law determines when a partnership obligation is “incurred.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       – In these circumstances, a person’s dissociation as a general partner has no effect on the person’s liability exposure, even if any or all of the following occur:
      </p>
      <p>
       • The certificate of limited partnership is amended to state that the person has dissociated as a general partner, as required by Section 202(d)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       • The person has filed a statement of dissociation, as permitted by Section 605(a)(3).
      </p>
      <p>
       • The person was the sole general partner, and the limited partnership is wound up by someone else under Section 802(c) or (d).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, amending the certificate of limited partnership to indicate dissolution would protect the person to the same extent as the amendment would protect the remaining general partners.
       See
    Sections 802(b)(2)(A) and 804.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       – The rule stated here for the “lingering liability” of a person dissociated as a general partner parallels the rule stated in Section 606 for the lingering apparent authority of a person dissociated as a general partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(2)(B)
       </b>
       – A person might have notice under Section 103(d)(1) as well as under Section 103(b)(1). under Section 103(b)(1).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsections (c) and (d)
       </b>
       – These provisions trace back to UPA (1914) § 36(2), (3).

      <p>
       For the definition of transferable interest, see Section 102(25). Absent a contrary provision in the partnership agreement or the consent of the partners, a “transferable interest” is the only interest in a limited partnership that can be transferred to a person not already a partner.
       See
    Section 702. As to whether a partner may transfer governance rights to a fellow partner, the question is moot absent a provision in the partnership agreement changing the default rule. See Section 406(a) (allocating general partner governance rights
       <i>
        per capita
       </i>
       ) and 406(b) (requiring unanimous agreement of all partners to take specified action). In the default mode, a general partner’s transfer of governance rights to another general partner: (i) does not increase the transferee’s governance rights; (ii) eliminates the transferor’s governance rights; and (iii) thereby changes the denominator but not the numerator in calculating governance rights
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: LCN Company is a limited partnership with three general partners, Laura, Charles, and Nora. The partnership agreement does not displace this act’s default rule on the allocation of governance rights among general partners. Thus, each general partner has 1/3 of those rights. Laura transfers her entire ownership interest to Charles. The transfer does not increase Charles’s governance rights but does eliminate Laura’s. After the transfer, Laura has no governance rights (regardless of whether Charles and Nora agree to expel Laura under Section 603(4)(B)). As a result, Charles and Nora each have 1/2 of the governance rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a transferable interest pledged as security is governed by Article 8 or 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code depends on the rules stated in those Articles.

      </h4>
      <p>
       One of the most fundamental characteristics of limited partnership law is its fidelity to the “pick your partner” principle.
       See, e.g., Bynum v. Frisby,
    73 Nev. 145, 149-50, 311 P.2d 972, 975 (Nev. 1957) (stating: (i) “the assignment of a partnership interest from one partner to a stranger does not bring that stranger into fiduciary relationship with the remaining partners”; and (ii) absent consent by the remaining partners “[t]he stranger remains a stranger” with no rights to management or even information).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is the core of the act’s provisions reflecting and protecting that principle.
       The provisions of this section apply regardless of whether the interest pertains to a general
       partner or a limited partner. A partner’s rights in a limited partnership are bifurcated into
       economic rights (the transferable interest) and governance rights (including management rights,
       consent rights, rights to information, rights to seek judicial intervention). Unless the partnership
       agreement otherwise provides, a partner acting without the consent of all other partners lacks
       both the power and the right to: (i) bestow partnership on a non-partner, Sections 301(b)(3), 401(b)(3); or (ii) transfer to a non-partner anything other than some or all of the partner’s
       transferable interest, Section 702(a)(3). The rights of a mere transferee are quite limited –
       i.e.,
    to
       receive distributions), Section 702(b), and, if the limited partnership dissolves and winds up, to
       receive specified information pertaining to the limited partnership from the date of dissolution.
       Section 702(c).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section applies regardless of whether the transferor is a partner, a transferee of a
       partner, a transferee of a transferee, etc.
       See
    Section 102(25) (defining “transferable interest” in
       terms of a right “initially owned by a person in the person’s capacity as a partner” regardless of
       “whether or not the person remains a partner or continues to own any part of the right”).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not directly consider whether a partner may transfer governance rights
       to another partner without obtaining consent from all the other partners. As noted above, Section
       701, cmt., the question is moot under this act’s default rule for allocating governance rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the question can be pivotal when the partnership agreement displaces the
       default rule on governance rights but does not determine whether transfer restrictions (whether
       contractual, statutory, or both) apply to transfers of governance rights from one partner to
       another. Case law is scant and pertains to LLCs. Nonetheless, the case law suggests that this act
       does not protect partners from control shifts that result from transfers among partners (as
       distinguished from transfers to non-partners who seek thereby to become partners).
       Blythe v.
       Bell,
    No. 11 CVS 933.
       2012 WL 7807800, at ¶ 6 (N.C. Dist. Dec. 10, 2012) (holding in a case of
       “first impression in North Carolina” that “in the absence of articles of incorporation or an
       operating agreement to the contrary . . . the assignment of control [(
       <i>
        i.e
       </i>
       ., governance)] interests
       between members is effective without unanimous member consent”);

       </i>
       25 A.3d 800, 810 (Del. Ch. 2011) (Strine, Ch.) (holding that the terms of the LLC
       agreement did not preclude one member of a three-member LLC from transferring the member’s
       entire interest (including governance rights) to a second member without first having the consent
       of the third member; stating that the third member’s “argument relies on a very thinly sliced
       version of [the ‘pick-your-partner principle, the strained version being] . . . that once one chooses his initial co-members, one continues to hold a veto over how much additional voting power they
       may acquire’; explaining that ‘[t]he problem for [the third member] is that nothing in the LLC
       Agreement supports [that member’s] reading of it that would require an already admitted
       Member, like [the acquirer
       <i>
        (i.e.,
       </i>
       the second member)], to be become once, twice (or even three
       times) a Member each and every time that Member acquires an additional block of Interests’”).
      </p>
      <p>
       Other law may affect the applicability of this section. See
       11 U.S.C. § 541(c)(1)
       (providing that, initially at least, all property of a debtor becomes part of the bankruptcy estate
       regardless of restrictions on transfer);
       UCC §§ 9-406, 9-408 (overriding specified restrictions on
       assignment in specified circumstances, regardless of whether state law or a contract impose the
       restrictions).
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, this section does not apply to the transfer of ownership interests in a partner
       that is an entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: ABC, LP has three partners: one general partner—Ralph (an individual);
       and two limited partners—Alice, Inc. (“Alice”), and Norton, LLC (“Norton”). Section
       702 applies to any attempt by Ralph, Alice, or Norton to transfer their respective
       partnership interest in ABC. Section 702 is inapplicable, however, to a change in control
       of Alice or Norton, or even a complete change in their respective ownership.

       ones. Thus, for example, a charging order under Section 703 effects a transfer of part of the

       Because Section 102(24) defines “transfer” to include “a transfer by operation of law,”
       this section affects the power of other law to effect transfers of a partner’s ownership interest.
       For example, a divorce court lacks the power to award a partner’s spouse anything beyond the
       partner’s transferable interest. Nor does the partner have the power to enter into a property
       settlement purporting to effect any greater transfer.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the divorce court, the best solution is to value the partner’s complete ownership
       interest
       (i.e.,
    the transferable interest as enhanced by the management and information rights and
       the standing to sue) and: (i) if possible, award the partner’s spouse marital property of equal
       value; or (ii) if not possible, award the partner’s spouse a money judgment and a charging order to enforce the judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granting the non-partner any part of the partner’s transferable interest is almost always
       imprudent; marital discord will almost inevitably carry over into the business relationship.
       Granting the partner’s ex-spouse the entire transferable interest is rarely a viable alternative. If
       the partner is an active participant in the limited partnership, the approach is impossible. The
       partner’s transferable interest will typically constitute much or all of the partner’s remuneration
       for the partner’s activity. Even if the partner is essentially passive, granting the transferable
       interest to the ex-spouse puts him or her at great risk as a “bare naked assignee.”
       See
    Section 107(b), cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a partner dies, subject to the limited partnership agreement other law may effect a
       transfer of the partner’s transferable interest to the partner’s estate or personal representative.
       However, for the reasons just stated, other law lacks the power to transfer anything more than a
       transferable interest. (Section 704 does provide extra information rights for the purposes of
       settling the estate of the deceased partner.)

       This subsection does not prevent a transferee from contracting with a partner-transferor to

       good faith and fair dealing, Section 409(d), or a fiduciary duty depends on the circumstances.

      <p>
       The charging order concept dates back to the English Partnership Act of 1890 and in the United States has been a fundamental part of law of unincorporated business organizations since 1914.
       See
    UPA (1914) § 28. As much a remedy limitation as a remedy, the charging order is the sole method by which a person acting as judgment creditor of a partner or transferee can extract value from the partner’s or transferee’s ownership interest in a limited partnership.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Subsection (g), cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, the judgment creditor of a partner or transferee is entitled to a
       charging order against the relevant transferable interest. While in effect, that order entitles the
       judgment creditor to whatever distributions would otherwise be due to the partner or transferee
       whose interest is subject to the order. However, the judgment creditor has no say in the timing or
       amount of those distributions. The charging order does not entitle the judgment creditor to
       accelerate any distributions or to otherwise interfere with the management and activities of the
       limited partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section applies regardless of whether the transferable interest at issue is owned by a
       person in the capacity of a general partner, limited partner, or transferee. The partnership
       agreement has no power to alter the provisions of this section to the prejudice of third parties.
       Section 105(c)(18).
      </p>
      <p>
       By its terms, this section does not apply to foreign limited partnerships.
       See
    Section
       102(12) (defining “[l]imited partnership” to mean “an entity
       <i>
        formed under this [act] or which becomes subject to this [act]”
       </i>
       ) (emphasis added);
       <i>
        see also Fannie Mae v. Heather Apartments
        Ltd. P'ship,
       </i>
       A13-0562, 2013 WL 6223564, at *6 (Minn. Ct. App. Dec. 2, 2013) (considering the
       remedies available to a judgment creditor with respect to the judgment debtor’s interest in a
       Cook Islands LLC; rejecting the debtor’s argument that the creditor’s “only remedy is to obtain
       a charging order under” [the Minnesota LLC statute]; explaining that “this argument fails
       because that statute only applies to Minnesota limited liability companies,” which that statute
       “defines . . . as ‘a limited liability company, other than a foreign limited liability company,
       <i>
        organized or governed by this chapter’”
       </i>
       ) (emphasis added) (statutory citations omitted).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —The phrase “judgment debtor” encompasses both partners and
       transferees. The lien pertains only to a distribution, which excludes “amounts constituting
       reasonable compensation for present or past service or payments made in the ordinary course of
       business under a bona fide retirement plan or other bona fide benefits program.” Section 102(4)(B). A judgment creditor that wishes to levy on such amounts should use the appropriate
       creditor’s remedy, such as garnishment (which may be subject to exemptions or exclusions not
       relevant to a charging order).
       Cf. PB Real Estate, Inc. v. Dem II Props.,
    719 A.2d 73, 76 (Conn.
       1998) (rejecting the contention of an LLC’s two members that “payments of $28,000 to each of
       them” should be treated “as expenses for wages” rather than as distributions).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether an application for a charging order must be served on the limited partnership,
       the judgment debtor, or both is a matter for other law; principally, the law of remedies and civil
       procedure. The order itself must be served on the limited partnership. Whether the order must
       also be served on the judgment debtor is a matter for other law.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a distribution consists of rights to acquire interests in a limited partnership, the
       charging order applies only to those rights within the definition of transferable interest.
       See
    Section 102(25) (defining transferable interest).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —Paragraph (2) refers to “other orders” rather than “additional orders.”
       Therefore, given appropriate circumstances, a court may invoke Paragraph (1), Paragraph (2), or
       both.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1)
       </b>
       —The receiver contemplated here is emphatically not a receiver for the
       limited partnership, but rather a receiver for the distributions subject to the charging order. The
       principal advantage provided by this paragraph is an expanded right to information. However,
       that right goes no further than “the extent necessary to effectuate the collection of distributions
       pursuant to a charging order.” For a correctly narrow reading of this provision, see
       Wells Fargo
       Bank, Nat’l Ass'n v. Continuous Control Solutions, Inc.
    , No. 11–1285, 2012 WL 3195759 (Iowa
       Ct. App. Aug. 8, 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(2)
       </b>
       —This paragraph must be understood in the context of: (i) the very
       limited nature of the charging order; and (ii) the importance of preventing overreaching on behalf
       of a person that is not a judgment creditor of the limited partnership, has no claim on the limited
       partnership’s assets, and has no right to interfere in the activities, affairs, and management of the
       limited partnership. In particular, the court’s power to make “all other orders” is limited to
       “orders necessary to give effect to the charging order.”
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A judgment creditor with a charging order believes that the limited
       partnership should invest less of its surplus in operations, leaving more funds for
       distributions. The creditor moves the court for an order directing the limited partnership
       to restrict re-investment. Subsection (b)(2) does not authorize the court to grant the
       motion.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A judgment creditor with a judgment for $10,000 against a partner obtains a
       charging order against the partner’s transferable interest. Having been properly served
       with the order, the limited partnership nonetheless fails to comply and makes a $3000
       distribution to the partner. The court has the power to order the limited partnership to pay
       $3000 to the judgment creditor to “give effect to the charging order.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Subsection (b)(2), the court has the power to decide whether a particular payment
       is a distribution, because that decision determines whether the payment is part of a transferable
       interest subject to a charging order.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: General Partner A of ABC, LP has for some years received distributions
       form the limited partnership. However, when a judgment creditor of General Partner A
       obtains a charging order against General Partner A’s transferable interest, the limited
       partnership ceases to make distributions to General Partner A and instead provides a
       salary to General Partner A equivalent to former distributions. A court might deem this
       salary a disguised distribution. (In any event, however, the salary will be subject to
       garnishment.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This act has no specific rules for determining the fate or effect of a charging order when
       the limited partnership undergoes a merger, conversion, interest exchange, or domestication
       under [Article] 11. In the proper circumstances, such an organic change might trigger an order
       under Subsection (b)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —The phrase “that distributions under the charging order will not pay the
       judgment debt within a reasonable period of time” comes from case law.
       See, e.g., Nigri v. Lotz,
       453 S.E.2d 780, 783 (Ga. Ct. App. 1995).
       <i>
        Stewart v. Lanier Park Med. Office Bldg., Ltd.,
       </i>
       578
       S.E.2d 572, 574 (Ga. Ct. App. 2003) (“Judicial sale may be appropriate where . . . it is apparent
       that distributions under the charging order will not pay the judgment debt within a reasonable
       amount of time.”). A purchaser at a foreclosure sale obtains only the very limited rights of a
       mere transferee under Section 702 and is in some ways more vulnerable and less powerful than
       the holder of a charging order. After foreclosure and sale, Subsection (b) no longer applies. More
       generally, the court is no longer involved in the matter. For the vulnerability of a transferee, see
       Section 107(b), comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —This provision allows the judgment debtor to end the charging order
       without need for a hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —Traditionally, charging order provisions referred to the possibility of
       “redeeming” an interest subject to a charging order. That usage was confusing, leaving several
       important questions unanswered. This act substitutes a far simpler approach, contemplating the limited partnership or its partners buying the underlying judgment and thereby dispensing with
       any interference the judgment creditor might seek to inflict on the partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       In many circumstances, buying the judgment is superior to the mechanism provided by
       this subsection, because: (i) this subsection requires full satisfaction of the underlying judgment; and (ii) the limited partnership or the other partners might be able to buy the judgment for less
       than face value. On the other hand, this subsection operates without need for the judgment
       creditor’s consent, so it remains a valuable protection in the event a judgment creditor seeks to
       do mischief to the limited partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a limited partnership should invoke this provision is a question for the general
       partners. Section 406(a). If the charging order pertains to the transferable interest of a general
       partner, subject to the partnership agreement, that partner should not be involved in deciding the
       question.
       See
    Section 409(b)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f)
       </b>
       —This subsection preserves otherwise applicable exemptions but does not
       create any.

       provision in UPA (1997) and stating that “it is clear that [the provision] does not create an
       exemption”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (g)
       </b>
       —This subsection does not override Uniform Commercial Code, Article 9,
       which may provide different remedies for a secured creditor acting in that capacity. A secured
       creditor with a judgment might decide to proceed under Article 9 alone, under this section alone,
       or under both Article 9 and this section. In the last-mentioned circumstance, the constraints of
       this section would apply to the charging order but not to the Article 9 remedies.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection is not intended to prevent a court from effecting a “reverse pierce” where
       appropriate. In a reverse pierce, the court conflates the entity and its owner to hold the entity
       liable for a debt of the owner.
       Cf. Trust, Inc. v. First Flight L.P.,
    580 S.E.2d 806, 810 (Va. 2003)
       (stating that “Virginia does recognize the concept of outsider reverse piercing and that this
       concept can be applied to a Virginia limited partnership”);

      </h4>
      <p>
       “Dissolution” has been a term of art in the law of unincorporated business organizations since at least the time of Roman law. JOSEPH STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE LAW OF PARTNERSHIP § 266, at 408 (2d ed. 1850) (“The Roman law . . . declared, that partnership might be dissolved in various ways . . . .”). Dissolution does not end a limited partnership’s existence but rather changes the purpose of that existence: “A dissolved limited partnership shall wind up its activities and affairs and . . . the partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up.” Section 802(a). The partnership may, but need not, amend its certificate of limited partnership to state that dissolution has occurred. Section 802(b)(2)(A). The limited partnership terminates when winding up is complete. The partnership may, but need not, file a statement of termination. Section 802(b)(2)(F).
      </p>
      <p>
       Except for Paragraphs (a)(6) and (7), this section comprises default rules. Paragraph 7 is fully mandatory, Section 105(c)(3)(B); Paragraph 6 is mandatory only with regard to the stated grounds for dissolution.
       See
    Section 105(c)(12), cmt. Moreover, a partnership agreement can provide additional causes of dissolution.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Subsection (a)(1). Variations to the statutory causes of dissolution are commonplace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 803 permits rescission of dissolution in some circumstances. In some circumstances, an amendment to the limited partnership agreement might avert dissolution – e.g., by revising an agreed-upon deadline for selling the partnership assets and winding up the business. A retroactive amendment may also be possible.
       See Kindred Ltd. P'ship v. Screen Actors Guild, Inc.,
    CV082220PSGPJWX, 2009 WL 279080, at *5–6 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 3, 2009) (giving effect to an amendment that retroactively eliminated an event of dissolution; noting that UPA (1997) § 802(b) permitted a partnership to rescind dissolution).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —Although most actions involving limited partner consent require unanimous consent (
    e.g.,
    Section 406(b)), this provision requires only the specified majority consent. Rights to receive distributions owned by a person that is both a general and a limited partner figure into the limited partner determination only to the extent those rights are owned in the person’s capacity as a limited partner.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 108(9)(C).
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: XYZ is a limited partnership with three general partners, each of whom is also a limited partner, and five other limited partners. Rights to receive distributions are allocated as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       Partner #1 as general partner—3%
      </p>
      <p>
       Partner #2 as general partner—2%
      </p>
      <p>
       Partner #3 as general partner—1%
      </p>
      <p>
       Partner #1 as limited partner—7%
      </p>
      <p>
       Partner #2 as limited partner—3%
      </p>
      <p>
       Partner #3 as limited partner—4%
      </p>
      <p>
       Partner #4 as limited partner—5%
      </p>
      <p>
       Partner #5 as limited partner—5%
      </p>
      <p>
       Partner #6 as limited partner—5%
      </p>
      <p>
       Partner #7 as limited partner—5%
      </p>
      <p>
       Partner #8 as limited partner—5%
      </p>
      <p>
       Several non-partner transferees, in the aggregate—55%
      </p>
      <p>
       Distribution rights owned by persons as limited partners amount to 39% of total distribution rights. A majority is therefore anything greater than 19.5%. If only Partners 1, 2, 3, and 4 consent to dissolve, the limited partnership is not dissolved. Together these partners own as limited partners 19% of the distribution rights owned by persons as limited partners—just short of the necessary majority. For purposes of this calculation, distribution rights owned by non-partner transferees are irrelevant. So, too, are distribution rights owned by persons as general partners. (However, dissolution under this provision requires “the consent of all general partners.”)
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(3)
       </b>
       —Historically, the dissociation of any general partner from a limited partnership could lead to dissolution (subject of course to the partnership agreement). This provision continues that concept, albeit while modernizing the consent mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(3)(A)
       </b>
       —Unlike Subsection (a)(2), this provision makes no distinction between distribution rights owned by persons as general partners and distribution rights owned by persons as limited partners. Distribution rights owned by non-partner transferees are irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(4) and (5)
       </b>
       —These provisions reflect the number and type of partners required for a limited partnership to come into existence. Section 201(d).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(6)
       </b>
       —The partnership agreement cannot vary the causes of dissolution stated in this provision. However, the partnership agreement may contain a forum selection clause or change the forum from “the appropriate court” to binding arbitration. Section 105(c)(12), cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to whether the court of another jurisdiction can properly order dissolution of a limited partnership formed under this act, the majority rule is clearly no. “[T]he courts of several states have held that jurisdiction to dissolve a corporation rests only in the courts of the state of incorporation.”
       In re Blixseth,
    484 B.R. 360, 370 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2012) (citing cases, including a case involving an LLC).

       </i>
       48 Cal. Rptr. 589, 591–93 (Cal. Ct. App. 1965) (explaining that “[w]e are . . . required to determine whether the courts of a state in which a foreign corporation has done business and in which its assets are there located have jurisdiction to wind up its affairs, even though the corporation was organized in another state,” stating that “the question is not one of jurisdiction or power in the court of the state which is not the legal domicile of a foreign corporation, but it is a question . . . of the balance of convenience, of whether considerations of public policy, efficiency, expedience and justice to all parties interested demand that jurisdiction be retained in the foreign court, or that it be declined under the rule of forum non conveniens,” and holding that “[t]he circumstances of the case at bench require a holding that the California courts assume jurisdiction of the winding up of [a Delaware corporation’s] affairs preparatory to a dissolution”).

       Under the default rules of this act, dissolution does not change governance arrangements. However, dissolution does change the context for determining for the purposes of Section 406(b)(3) whether to “sell, lease, exchange, or otherwise dispose of all, or substantially all, of the limited partnership’s property, with or without the good will” is “other than in the usual and regular course of the limited partnership’s activities and affairs.”

       — The particular circumstances determine how long winding up may continue without giving “good cause” for court intervention under Section 702(d)(2). There is no “hard and fast” rule.
       See, e.g., Mathis v. Meyeres,
    574 P.2d 447, 450 (Alaska 1978) (stating that we are aware of [no authority] requiring that deadlines be set in the winding up of a partnership”);

       “Winding up usually entails the time necessary for the partners to finish old business, collect and pay debts, and finally distribute remaining assets to the partners.”
       Gibson v. Deuth,
    270 N.W.2d 632, 635 (Iowa 1978). “Generally the best interests of the partnership will be served by winding up the partnership affairs as quickly as possible.”

        Doting v. Trunk,
       </i>
       856 P.2d 536, 540 (Mont. 1993). However, in some circumstances, a long period of winding up is not only appropriate but necessary.

       306 N.E.2d 769, 772 (Ohio Ct. App. 1972) (“[I]f the only means of availing the partners of the benefit of the value of the lease would be to continue to operate under such lease until its expiration, then such operation may continue as part of the winding up of the partnership affairs after dissolution. It is not necessary that a partnership, in the absence of the consent of all the partners, abandon a valuable asset upon dissolution merely because it may have no ready market value, but the value of such asset can continue to inure to the benefit of the partners through the continuation of the partnership after dissolution.”).

      <p>
       This section provides the “power to bind” rules applicable once dissolution occurs. The section originated in UPA (1997), which significantly departed from the approach of UPA (1914). ULPA (2001) accepted the UPA (1997) construct but revised the language for stylistic reasons. The Harmonization Project accepted the ULPA (2001) language.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, this section parallels Section 606 (power to bind of a person dissociated as general partner when dissolution does not result from the dissociation). However, one significant difference exists. Section 606(a)(2)(A) contains a provision analogous to a statute of repose. A person’s power to bind the partnership terminates two years after the date of dissociation. Subsection (b) contains a comparable provision, but Subsection (a) does not.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsections (a) and (b)
       </b>
       —Subsection (a) states the power-to-bind rules for persons still general partners when dissolution occurs. Subsection (b) pertains to persons dissociated as a general partner before dissolution, including a general partner whose dissociation results in dissolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(1)
       </b>
       —This paragraph states a rule of inherent agency power.
       See
    RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY § 8A (1958) defining “inherent agency power” as “the power of an agent which is derived not from authority, apparent authority or estoppel, but solely from the agency relation and exists for the protection of persons harmed by or dealing with a servant or other agent”). Thus, a general partner might act without actual or apparent authority and still bind the limited partnership. The partnership agreement cannot change the stated rule, because the rule pertains to the rights of third parties under this act.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 105(c)(18).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a general partner’s words or conduct trigger this paragraph, thereby binding the limited partnership, and the general partner lacks the actual authority to do so, the general partner breaches an agent’s duty to act within authority, and is liable to the limited partnership for any resulting damages.
       RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY § 8.09(1) (2006) (“An agent has a duty to take action only within the scope of the agent's actual authority”). The general partner might also be liable for breach of the partnership agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —A person might have notice under Section 103(d)(2)(A) (amendment of certificate of limited partnership to indicate dissolution) as well as under Section 103(b)(1) (reason to know).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection deals with the post-dissolution power to bind of a person dissociated as a general partner. For the most part: (i) Paragraph 1 replicates Section 606, pertaining to the pre-dissolution power to bind of a person dissociated as a general partner; and (ii) Paragraph 2 replicates Subsection (a) of this section, which states the post-dissolution power to bind of a person who is still a general partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a person dissociated as a general partner to bind a dissolved limited partnership:
      </p>
      <p>
       • the person’s dissociation must have:
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>

       This section parallels Section 606(b). It is possible for more than one person to be liable under this section on account of the same limited partnership obligation. This act does not provide any rule for apportioning liability in that circumstance.

       —If the limited partnership is not a limited liability limited partnership, the liability created by this paragraph includes liability under Sections 404(a), 607(b), and 607(c). The paragraph also applies when a partner or person dissociated as a general partner suffers damage due to a contract of guaranty.

      <p>
       Other law determines liability (if any) to a person that is neither a general partner nor dissociated as a general partner.

       A general partner’s liability under Sections 404 and 607 is vicarious liability—liability solely by status and solely for the “debts, obligations, and other liabilities of the limited partnership.” To the extent a claim pertaining to the underlying debt, obligation, or other liability is barred, a claim pertaining to the corresponding vicarious liability should likewise be barred.

       In some circumstances, this act requires a partner to make payments to the limited partnership.
       See, e.g.,
    Sections 502(b), 505(a), 505(b), 810(c). In other circumstances, this act requires a partner to make payments to other partners.
       <i>
        See, e.g.,
       </i>
       Sections 505(c), 810(d). In no circumstances does this act require a partner to make a payment for the purpose of equalizing or otherwise reallocating capital losses incurred by partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: XYZ Limited Partnership (“XYZ”) has one general partner and four limited partners. As indicated by its name, XYZ is not a limited liability limited partnership. According to XYZ’s required information, the value of each partner’s contributions to XYZ are:
      </p>
      <p>
       General partner—$5,000
      </p>
      <p>
       Limited partner #1—$10,000
      </p>
      <p>
       Limited partner #2—$15,000
      </p>
      <p>
       Limited partner #3—$20,000
      </p>
      <p>
       Limited partner #4—$25,000
      </p>
      <p>
       XYZ is unsuccessful and eventually dissolves without ever having made a distribution to its partners. XYZ lacks any assets with which to return to the partners the value of their respective contributions. No partner is obliged to make any payment either to the limited partnership or to fellow partners to adjust these capital losses. These losses are not part of “the limited partnership’s obligations to creditors.” Section 810(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Same facts, except that Limited Partner #4 loaned $25,000 to XYZ, and XYZ lacks the assets to repay the loan. The general partner must contribute to the limited partnership whatever funds are necessary to enable XYZ to satisfy the obligation owned to Limited Partner #4 on account of the loan. Section 810(a) and (c).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection is non-waivable as to creditors who are not partners.
       See
    Section 105(c)(18) (stating that the partnership agreement may not “restrict the rights under this [act] of a person other than a partner”). However, if a creditor is willing, a dissolved limited partnership may certainly make agreements with the creditor specifying the terms under which the limited partnership will “discharge the partnership’s obligations to” the creditor.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —For the most part, this subsection states default rules. For example, partnership agreements often provide for different distribution rights upon liquidation than during operations. However, distributions under these subsections (or otherwise under the partnership agreement) are subject to charging orders, Section 703. As to the extent the partnership agreement can be amended to affect the distribution rights of persons already transferees, see Section 107(b).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This section applies obligation by obligation, because a person—
    qua
    general partner or person dissociated as a general partner—is required to contribute to the limited partnership to satisfy a partnership obligation only if, when the obligation was incurred: (i) the person was a general partner; and (ii) the limited partnership was not an LLLP.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 404(b), (c). As for when a limited partnership obligation is incurred, see Section 404(b) and (c), comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The partnership agreement can change the allocation
       inter se
    general partners and persons dissociated as general partners but cannot prejudice the rights of non-partner creditors.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: The A-B Limited Partnership (the “Partnership”) owes Creditor $150, an obligation incurred when General Partners A and B were the only general partners, sharing distributions equally, and the Limited Partnership was not an LLLP. The Partnership has no funds to pay Creditor. Although Subsection (c)(1) would require Partners A and B each to contribute equally
       (i.e.,
    $75), the A-B Partnership Agreement provides that General Partner A has the entire contribution obligation and General Partner B has none. As between General Partners A and B, General Partner A is obligated to contribute $150 and General Partner B nothing. However, as to Creditor, General Partner B still has a contribution obligation of $75.
      </p>
      <p>
       This formal distinction will have practical consequences only if General Partner A does not contribute the full $150. Also, Creditor may have problems establishing standing.
       Cf
    . Section 505, cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)(2) and (3)
       </b>
       —These provisions are analogous to buy-sell provisions that: (i) provide that an owner’s effort to sell the ownership interest triggers an option to purchase allocated among all the other owners; (ii) make the option conditional on the entire interest being purchased; and (iii) provide for successive allocations to take up any previous allocations that were not unexercised.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —If a limited partnership has been a limited liability limited partnership throughout the partnership’s existence, this subsection is consistent with this act’s approach to loss sharing. If a partnership has been a limited liability limited partnership during only part of the partnership’s existence, the issue of loss sharing upon dissolution: (i) can be exceedingly complicated, varying radically depending on the circumstances; (ii) is therefore not amenable to a statutory “gap filler”; and (iii) thus should always be addressed in the partnership agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in case the partnership agreement does not address the issue, this act must provide a default rule.
       See
    Section 105(b), cmt. (“To the extent the partnership agreement does not determine an inter se matter, this act determines the matter.”). This subsection applies to fill the gap. This approach has the virtues of simplicity and certainty but in no way resembles what “typical” partners might agree if they were to consider the matter
       <i>
        ab initio
       </i>
       , especially if the partnership was never a LLLP.

       Many failures to comply with statutory requirements that may give rise to administrative dissolution occur because of oversight or inadvertence and are usually corrected promptly when brought to the entity’s attention. Subsections (b) and (c) therefore provide a mandatory notice by the filing office to each limited partnership subject to administrative dissolution and a sixty-day grace period following the notice before the statement of administrative dissolution may be filed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In most instances, the issue whether the limited partnership is subject to administrative dissolution will not be controverted. If a limited partnership is administratively dissolved, it may petition the filing office for reinstatement under Section 812 and, if reinstatement is denied, the company may appeal to the courts under Section 813.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a practical matter, administrative dissolution permits the filing office to clear the record of “dead wood” and free up names.

      <p>
       Some states require that reinstatement be sought within two years of administrative dissolution. Other states provide a longer time, or do not impose any time limit. Imposing no limit risks abuse by unscrupulous people seeking to reinstate and appropriate for improper ends a dormant limited partnership that has been abandoned by its partners. On the other hand, reinstatement is intended as a safety net for the inattentive (
    i.e.,
    for people in charge of a limited partnership who have neglected to file an annual report or otherwise subjected the limited partnership to administrative dissolution). If the deadline comes too soon, the safety net may be gone before the inattentive even learn that administrative dissolution has occurred.

      <p>
       Because the grounds for administrative dissolution under Section 811 are limited and straight-forward, it is unlikely there will be a dispute about whether a limited partnership has corrected the reasons for its administrative dissolution. If a dissolved limited partnership disagrees with a determination by the filing office to deny the partnership’s application for reinstatement, this section gives the partnership a limited right to seek judicial review of the denial of reinstatement.

      </p>
      <p>
       The distinction between direct and derivative claims protects the partnership agreement. If any partner can sue directly over any management issue, the mere threat of suit can interfere with the partners’ agreed-upon arrangements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although in ordinary contractual situations it is axiomatic that each party to a contract has standing to sue for breach of that contract, within a limited partnership different circumstances typically exist. A partner does not have a direct claim against a general partner merely because the general partner has breached the partnership agreement. Likewise a general partner’s violation of this act does not automatically create a direct claim for every other partner. To have standing in his, her, or its own right, a partner plaintiff must be able to show a harm that occurs independently of the harm caused or threatened to be caused to the limited partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Through grossly negligent conduct, in violation of Section 409(c), the general partner of a limited partnership reduces the net assets of the limited partnership by fifty percent, which in turns decreases the value of Limited Partner A’s investment by $3,000,000. A has no standing to bring a direct claim; the damage is merely derivative of the damage first suffered by the limited partnership. The partner may, however, bring a derivative claim. Sections 902—906.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: Same facts, except in addition to violating Section 409(c), the general partner’s conduct breaches an express provision of the partnership agreement to which Limited Partner A is a signatory. The analysis and the result are the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       EXAMPLE: A partnership agreement defines “distributable cash” and requires the limited partnership to periodically distribute that cash among all partners. The limited partnership’s general partner fails to distribute the cash. Each partner has a direct claim against the general partner and the limited partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reference to “threatened injury” is to encompass potential claims for preventative relief, such as a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section’s standing rule is subject to reasonable alterations by the partnership agreement.

       —This paragraph will be inapposite if the limited partnership has only two partners, one of whom is the derivative plaintiff. In that limited circumstance, the plaintiff’s death would cause the derivative action to abate. The “pick your partner” principal enshrined in Section 702 would prevent the decedent’s heirs from succeeding to plaintiff status in the derivative action (except in the unlikely event that the remaining partner consents to the heirs becoming partners). The analysis and result will be the same if the derivative plaintiff is an entity whose existence terminates.
      </p>
      <p>
       This act takes no position on whether:
      </p>
      <p>
       • the death of partner abates a direct claim against the limited partnership or a fellow partner; and
      </p>
      <p>
       • bringing a direct claim precludes a person from being a proper plaintiff for a derivative claim.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
       Although special litigation committees are best known in the corporate field, they are no more inherently corporate than derivative litigation or the notion that an organization is a person distinct from its owners. An “SLC” can serve as an ADR mechanism, help protect an agreed upon arrangement from strike suits, protect the interests of partners who are neither plaintiffs nor defendants (if any), and bring the benefits of a specially tailored business judgment to any judicial decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section’s approach corresponds to established law in most jurisdictions, modified to fit the typical governance structures of a limited partnership. Use of an SLC is optional. A partnership agreement can preclude the use of SLCs, rendering this section inapplicable, but cannot otherwise vary this section.
    See
    Section 105(c)(15).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(1)
       </b>
       —Sections 304 and 407 pertain to information rights. On the availability of these remedies pending the SLC’s investigation,
    compare
    Section 410,
       <i>
        with Kaufman v. Computer Assoc. Int’l, Inc.,
       </i>
       No. Civ.A. 699-N, 2005 WL 3470589, at *1 (Del. Ch. Dec. 21, 2005) (presenting “the question of whether to stay a books and records action under 8 Del. C. § 220 at the request of a special litigation committee when a derivative action encompassing substantially the same allegations of wrongdoing filed by different plaintiffs is pending in another jurisdiction”; concluding “[f]or reasons that have much to do with the light burden imposed by the plaintiff's demand in this case . . . that the special litigation committee's motion to stay the books and records action should be denied”).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —The standard stated for judicial review of the SLC determination follows
    Auerbach v. Bennett,
    393 N.E.2d 994 (N.Y. 1979) rather than
       <i>
        Zapata Corp. v. Maldonado,
       </i>
       430 A.2d 779 (Del. 1981), because the latter’s reference to a court’s business judgment has generally not been followed in other states. In essence, an SLC is intended to function as a surrogate decision-maker, allowing the limited partnership to make what is fundamentally a business decision. If a court determines that “the members of the committee were disinterested and independent and [that] . . . the committee conducted its investigation and made its recommendation in good faith, independently, and with reasonable care, with the committee having the burden of proof,” it makes no sense to substitute the court’s legal judgment for the business judgment of the SLC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Houle v. Low,
    556 N.E.2d 51, 58 (Mass. 1990) contains an excellent explanation of the court’s role in reviewing an SLC decision:
      </p>
      
      <p>
       The value of a special litigation committee is coextensive with the extent to which that committee truly exercises business judgment. In order to ensure that special litigation committees do act for the [entity]’s best interest, a good deal of judicial oversight is necessary in each case. At the same time, however, courts must be careful not to usurp the committee's valuable role in exercising business judgment. . . . [A] special litigation committee must be independent, unbiased, and act in good faith. Moreover, such a committee must conduct a thorough and careful analysis regarding the plaintiff's derivative suit. . . . The burden of proving that these procedural requirements have been met must rest, in all fairness, on the party capable of making that proof—the [entity].

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —Following a long-established tradition, this act does not state what constitutes “do[ing] business in this state.” Instead, Section 1005 provides a non-exhaustive list of “[a]ctivities of a foreign limited partnership which do not constitute doing business in this state.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —The purpose of this subsection is to induce foreign limited partnerships to register without imposing harsh or erratic sanctions. Often the failure to register is a result of inadvertence or bona fide disagreement as to the scope of Section 1005, which is necessarily imprecise. Thus, the imposition of harsh sanctions in those situations is inappropriate. The sanction of closing the courts of the state to suits brought by foreign limited partnerships that should have registered is not a punitive one. If a foreign limited partnership should have registered and failed to do so, it may still enforce its contractual and other rights simply by registering.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if a court dismisses a case under this subsection rather than staying the proceedings pending the foreign limited partnership’s registration, a statute of limitations problem may occur.
    See Corco, Inc. v. Ledar Transport, Inc
    ., 946 P.2d 1009, 1010 (Kan. Ct. App. 1997) (“[T]he proper remedy was to dismiss [the unregistered entity’s] counterclaim without prejudice rather than with prejudice. This would leave [the entity] the opportunity to comply with the statutes and then reassert its claim against [the defendant]. On the other hand, it would also leave the risk that the statute of limitations might run against [the entity].”).
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection does not prevent a foreign limited partnership that has failed to register from “defending” an action or proceeding. The distinction between “maintaining” an action or proceeding under this subsection and “defending” an action or proceeding under Subsection (c) is determined on the basis of whether affirmative relief is sought. A nonregistered foreign limited partnership may interpose any defense or permissive or mandatory counterclaim to defeat a claimed recovery, but may not obtain an affirmative judgment based on the counterclaim without first registering.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —In addition to permitting a non-registered foreign limited partnership doing business in this state to defend (but not maintain) an action or proceeding, this section makes clear that failure to register does not impair the validity of a foreign limited partnership’s acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —This subsection preserves the effectiveness of a foreign limited partnership’s liability shield applicable under the limited partnership’s governing law.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This act does not attempt to formulate an inclusive definition of what constitutes doing business in a state. Rather, the concept is defined in a negative fashion by Subsections (a) and (b), which state that certain activities do not constitute doing business.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general terms, any conduct more regular, systematic, or extensive than that described in Subsection (a) constitutes doing business and requires the foreign limited partnership to register to do business. Typical conduct requiring registration includes maintaining an office to conduct local intrastate business, selling personal property not in interstate commerce, entering into contracts relating to the local business or sales, and owning or using real estate for general purposes. But the passive owning of real estate for investment purposes does not constitute doing business.
    See
    Subsection (a)(10).
      </p>
      <p>
       The test of “doing business” defined in a negative way in Subsections (a) and (b) applies only to the question of whether a foreign limited partnership’s contacts with the state are such that it must register under this section. The test is not applicable to other questions such as whether the foreign limited partnership is amenable to service of process under state “long-arm” statutes or liable for state or local taxes. A foreign limited partnership that has registered (or is required to register) will generally be subject to suit and state taxation in the state, while a foreign limited partnership that is subject to service of process or state taxation in a state will not necessarily be required to register.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —The list of activities set forth in this subsection is not exhaustive.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(1)
       </b>
       —A foreign limited partnership is not “doing business” solely because it resorts to the courts of the state to recover an indebtedness, enforce an obligation, recover possession of personal property, obtain the appointment of a receiver, intervene in a pending proceeding, bring a petition to compel arbitration, file an appeal bond, or pursue appellate remedies. Similarly, a foreign limited partnership is not required to register merely because it files a complaint with a governmental agency or participates in an administrative proceeding within the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —A foreign limited partnership does not “do business” within a state under this section merely because some of its internal affairs occur within a state. Thus, a foreign limited partnership may hold meetings of its partners within a state without first registering. A foreign limited partnership also may maintain offices or agencies within a state relating solely to the transfer, exchange or registration of its interests without registering. Other activities relating to the internal affairs of the foreign limited partnership that do not constitute doing business under this section include having officers or representatives who reside within or are physically present in the state; while there, the officers or representatives may make executive decisions relating to the internal affairs of the foreign limited partnership without imposing on the foreign limited partnership the requirement that it register, if these activities are not so regular and systematic as to cause the residence to be viewed as a business office.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(5)
       </b>
       —Under this paragraph, a foreign limited partnership need not register if it sells goods in the state through independent contractors. These transactions are viewed as transactions by the independent contractors, not by the foreign limited partnership itself even though the foreign limited partnership sets some limits or ground rules for its contractors. If these controls are sufficiently pervasive, however, the foreign limited partnership may be deemed to be selling for itself in intrastate commerce, and not through the independent contractors and therefore engaged in doing business in the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(7) and (8)
       </b>
       —The mere act of making a loan by a foreign limited partnership that is not in the business of making loans does not constitute doing business in the state in which the loan is made. On the same theory, a foreign limited partnership may obtain security for the repayment of a loan, and foreclose or enforce the lien or security interest to collect the loan, without being deemed to be doing business. Similarly, a refunding or “roll over” of a loan or its adjustment or compromise does not involve doing business.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(9)
       </b>
       —The concept of “doing business” involves regular, repeated, and continuing business contacts of a local nature. A single agreement or isolated transaction within a state does not constitute doing business if there is no intention to repeat the transaction or engage in similar transactions. This act does not impose the limitation found in some statutes, such as section 15.01(b)(10) of the Model Business Corporation Act, that the isolated transaction be completed within thirty days. A foreign limited partnership should not be required to register simply because it engages in an isolated transaction that takes longer than thirty days to complete.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(11)
       </b>
       —A foreign limited partnership is not “doing business” within the meaning of this section if it is transacting business in interstate commerce.
    See
    Subsection (a)(6) (stating that soliciting or obtaining orders that must be accepted outside the state before they become contracts is not “doing business” within the meaning of this section).
      </p>
      <p>
       These exclusions reflect the provisions of the United States Constitution that grant to the United States Congress exclusive power over interstate commerce, and preclude states from imposing restrictions or conditions upon this commerce. This subsection should be construed in a manner consistent with judicial decisions under the United States Constitution. Under those decisions, a foreign entity is not required to register even though it sells goods within the state if they are shipped to the purchasers in interstate commerce. Thus, a foreign limited partnership need not register even if it also does work and performs acts within the state incidental to the interstate business (
    e.g
    ., if it takes or enforces a security interest incidental to these transactions). Nor is it required to register merely because it sends traveling salespeople or solicitors into a state so long as contracts are not made within the state. Similarly, an office may be maintained by a foreign limited partnership in this state without registering if the office’s functions relate solely to interstate commerce. Purchases of goods may of course be in interstate commerce as readily as sales. Thus, the purchase of personal property in this state by a foreign limited partnership for shipment in interstate commerce out of the state does not require the entity to register.

       When a registered foreign limited partnership has converted to a domestic “filing entity” or domestic limited liability partnership, information about the entity in its capacity as a domestic entity will continue to be of record in the office of the filing office. At that point, there is no further reason for the entity to be registered as a foreign limited partnership, and this section automatically treats its prior registration as withdrawn.

       The purpose of this section is to clarify the status of the foreign limited partnership in the public records of the state. A filing under this section has the two-fold effect of canceling the authority of the foreign limited partnership to do business in the state while at the same time reregistering the former foreign limited partnership as the new type of foreign entity. If the reregistered foreign entity subsequently wishes to cancel its registration to do business in the state, it may do so under the statute of this state pertaining the registration of the new type of foreign entity.

      Introductory Comment
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     This article deals comprehensively with both same-type and cross-type mergers and interest exchanges and with conversions and domestications. For this article to apply, at least one participant organization must be a domestic limited partnership. For a foreign organization to be involved, its organic law must permit the organization’s participation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Part 1 contains definitions specific to this article as well as provisions applicable to all transactions authorized by this article.
    </p>
    <p>
     Part 2 governs mergers and is an amalgamation of existing entity law, both unincorporated and incorporated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Part 3 governs interest exchanges, previously a feature only of corporate law. Part 3 is derived from the share exchange provisions in chapter 11 of the Model Business Corporation Act.
    </p>
    <p>
     Part 4 governs conversions, a one-step procedure by which an entity changes from one type of entity to another type while nonetheless continuing in existence as the same legal entity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Part 5 governs domestications, a procedure by a domestic limited partnership can become a foreign limited partnership or vice versa, in each instance with the company remaining the same legal entity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Part 2 sets the paradigm for Parts 3, 4, and 5, because mergers are long established, and merger rules and concepts are familiar to business lawyers. Moreover, conversions and domestications could formerly be accomplished via mergers (with a new entity), and an interest exchange produces the same result as a triangular merger. The comments to Part 2 are thus relevant to understanding Parts 3, 4, and 5. This article contemplates transactions in which the surviving entity is neither a filing entity nor otherwise of record in the filing office (
    e.g
    ., the merger of a limited partnership into a non-LLP general partnership). As a result, a filing under this article may be the first time that a filing office takes cognizance of an entity’s existence.

        Official Comment.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This section defines the terms that are used in this article. Many of the definitions describe attributes that are significant in some forms of entity and not in others. For example, the concept of separate “distributional” and “governance” interests are inherent in unincorporated entities but have no counterpart in corporations. In addition, because some statutes use different terms to describe the same transaction, the definitions are intended to be broad enough to encompass those similar transactions, regardless of how described.
    See, e.g
    ., Paragraph 10 (defining domestication).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Acquired entity” [(1)]
       </b>
       —This definition recognizes that an interest exchange may involve only the acquisition of a particular “class” or “series” of interests in an entity. Model Business Corporation Act section 6.01 does not expressly define “classes” or “series.” Because the interests of members in an unincorporated business organization often tend to be distinctive, it may be that each member’s interest will comprise a separate class or series. For an explanation of a new and different meaning of the word “series,” see Section 1131, introductory comment. The term “acquired entity” does not encompass series under that new meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Acquiring entity” [(2)]
       </b>
       —An “acquiring entity” is an entity that acquires the interests of the acquired entity in an interest exchange governed by Part 3 of this article.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Conversion” [(3)]
       </b>
       —The term “conversion” means a transaction authorized by Part 4 pursuant to which an entity of one type is converted into an entity of another type. As used in this act, the term “conversion” does not include a transaction in which an entity changes the jurisdiction in which it is organized but does not change to a different form of entity; that type of transaction is referred to in this act as a “domestication” and is governed by Part 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Converted entity” [(4)]
       </b>
       —This term is used in Part 4 to describe the entity that results from a conversion.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Converting entity” [(5)]
       </b>
       —A converting entity is the entity that becomes the converted entity under Part 4.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Distributional interest” [(6)]
       </b>
       —This term is similar to the concept of a “transferable interest” found in this act and the organic laws of several other types of unincorporated entities, but has a broader meaning because the scope of this act includes entities in addition to those whose organic law uses the term “transferable interest.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Domestic” [(7)]
       </b>
       —The term “domestic”, when used in this article with respect to an entity, refers to an entity whose internal affairs are governed by the organic laws of this state. Except in the case of general partnerships and unincorporated nonprofit associations, this will mean an entity that is formed, organized, or incorporated under domestic law. In the case of a general partnership organized under UPA (1997) (Last Amended 2013), the term will mean a general partnership whose governing law under UPA (1997) § 104 is the law of the adopting state. Under that section, the governing law is determined by the location of the partnership’s principal office, except for limited liability partnerships whose governing law is the law of the state where the LLP’s statement of qualification is filed. It is a factual question whether the activities and organization of an unincorporated nonprofit association make it a domestic or foreign entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Domesticated limited partnership” [(8)]
       </b>
       —This term is used in Part 5 and means the entity that is domesticated pursuant to Part 5. By the nature of the transaction, the domesticated entity will be of the same type as the domesticating entity (
    i.e
    ., a limited partnership).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Domesticating limited partnership” [(9)]
       </b>
       —This term is used in Part 5 and means the entity that is domesticated pursuant to Part 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Domestication” [(10)]
       </b>
       —The term “domestication” means a transaction of the kind authorized by Part 5 pursuant to which an entity may change its
    jurisdiction
    of formation
       <i>
        but not its type
       </i>
       so long as the laws of the foreign jurisdiction permit the domestication. The legal effect of the domestication of a limited partnership out of this state will be governed by the laws of both this state and the foreign jurisdiction. Some statutes include what is described in this act as “domestication” in their definition of a “conversion.”
       <i>
        See, e.g
       </i>
       ., COLO. REV. STAT. § 7-90-201. It is intended that the domestication provisions of this act will apply to a transaction that may be characterized under another act as a “conversion” if the transaction meets the definition of “domestication” under this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Entity” [(11)]
       </b>
       —This definition determines the overall scope of the act because only an “entity” may participate in the transactions authorized by Parts 2 (mergers), 3 (interest exchanges), 4 (conversions), and 5 (domestications).
    See
    Sections 1121 (authorization of mergers), 1131 (authorization of interest exchanges), 1141 (authorization of conversions), 1151 (authorization of domestications).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subparagraph (A)(x) is a “catch-all” provision that includes within the definition of “entity” any type of organization recognized under the law of this state, which is not listed specifically in the preceding paragraphs of this definition. Subparagraph (A)(x) is intended to include all forms of private organizations, regardless of whether organized for profit, and artificial legal persons other than those excluded by Subparagraph (B). This definition does not exclude regulated entities such as public utilities, banks, and insurance companies. Should a state desire to exclude certain types of regulated entities or any of the entities listed in Subparagraph (A)(i)–(x) from participating in transactions permitted by this act for policy reasons, that may be done by listing those types of entities in Section 1107(a), or by permitting those type of entities to engage in transactions under this act generally but prohibiting certain types of transactions by listing those transactions in Section 1107(b).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unincorporated nonprofit associations are treated as a type of entity in Subparagraph (A)(viii) because section 5 of the Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act (2008) (Last Amended 2013) specifically states that an unincorporated nonprofit association is an entity. In many states, the status of a nonprofit association may not be clear. Nevertheless, in most states a nonprofit association has the power to acquire an interest in real property in its own name and therefore would qualify as an “entity” under Subparagraph (A)(x). See Section 6 of the UUNAA, which gives an unincorporated nonprofit association the power to acquire in its own name an interest in real property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subparagraph (B)(i) of this definition excludes a sole proprietorship from the concept of an “entity.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Trusts with a predominately donative purpose, such as inter vivos and testamentary trusts and charitable trusts, are treated in many states as having a separate legal existence, but they have been excluded from the definition of “entity” (and thus are not within the scope of this article) under Subparagraph (B)(ii) because they should not be able to engage in transactions under this act as a matter of public policy. Trusts that carry on a business, however, such as business and statutory entity trusts, are “entities.”
    See
    Subparagraph (A)(ix).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subparagraph (B)(iii) of this definition excludes from the concept of an “entity” any form of co-ownership of property or sharing of returns from property that is not listed in Subparagraph (A) and is not a partnership under UPA (1997). In that connection, Section 202(c) of that act provides in part:
      </p>
      
      <p>
       In determining whether a partnership is formed, the following rules apply:

       <li id="t07c13.1p11s7-13.1-1101-officialcommentol12">
        The sharing of gross returns does not by itself establish a partnership, even if the persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in property from which the returns are derived.

       Limited liability partnerships and limited liability limited partnerships are “entities” because they are general partnerships and limited partnerships respectively that have made the additional required election claiming LLP or LLLP status. A limited liability partnership is not, therefore, a separate type of entity from the underlying general or limited partnership that has elected limited liability partnership status. Thus, for example, the election of a general partnership to become a limited liability partnership is not a conversion subject to Article 4.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Subparagraph (B)(iv), decedent’s estates are excluded from the definition of an entity for the same policy reason as trusts with a predominately donative purpose and charitable trusts.
      </p>
      <p>
       This same public policy rationale is the justification for the exclusion of governmental subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities in Subparagraph (B)(v).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Filing entity” [(12)]
       </b>
       —Whether an entity is a filing entity is determined by reference to whether its legal existence requires the filing of a document with the state filing officer. To fit within this definition, the filing must be necessary but need not be sufficient to form the entity.
    See, e.g
    ., Section 201(d) (“A limited partnership is formed when the certificate of limited partnership becomes effective [
       <i>
        and
       </i>
       ] at least two persons have become partners,” one of them becoming a general partner and the other a limited partner) (emphasis added); ULLCA (2006) (Last Amended) § 201(d).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the statute refers to the “formation” of an entity, the term is intended to encompass corporations that are “incorporated,” as well as other filing entities whose statutes refer to them as being “organized.” Business trusts present a special problem. In some states, a business trust could be a filing entity or a common law relationship, while in other states business trusts are only recognized at common law. A statutory trust entity formed under the Uniform Statutory Trust Entity Act (2009) (Last Amended 2013) section 201(a) is a filing entity, because a statutory trust entity is formed by the filing office filing a certificate of trust pertaining to the entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “filing entity” does not include a limited liability partnership because, while a filed document is a precondition to LLP status, that document (a statement of qualification under UPA (1997) (Last Amended 2013) § 901) does not form the underlying entity. A limited liability limited partnership, on the other hand, is a filing entity because the underlying limited partnership is formed by filing a certificate of limited partnership. ULPA (2001) (Last Amended 2013) § 201(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Foreign” [(13)]
       </b>
       —The term “foreign entity” includes any non-domestic entity of any type. Where a foreign entity is a filing entity, the entity is governed by the laws of the state of filing. A nonfiling foreign entity is governed by the laws governing its internal affairs. It is a factual question whether a general partnership whose internal affairs are governed by UPA (1914) is a domestic or foreign partnership. A UPA (1914) partnership will likely be deemed to be a domestic entity where the greatest nexus of contacts are found. The domestic or foreign characterization of partnerships under the UPA (1997) (Last Amended 2013) that have not become limited liability partnerships will be governed by Section 104(2) (“the law of the jurisdiction in which the partnership has its principal office”) or the partnership agreement. (Section 104(2) is a default rule.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Governance interest” [(14)]
       </b>
       —A governance interest is typically only part of the interest that a person will hold in an unincorporated entity and is usually coupled with a distributional interest (or economic rights). Memberships in some nonprofit corporations and unincorporated nonprofit associations consist solely of governance interests and memberships in other nonprofit entities may not include either governance interests or distributional interests. In some unincorporated business entities, including partnerships, there is a more limited right to transfer governance interests than there is to transfer distributional interests. An interest holder in such an unincorporated business entity who transfers only a distributional interest and retains the governance interest will also retain the status of an interest holder. Whether a transferee who acquires only a distributional interest will acquire the status of an interest holder is determined by the definition of “interest holder.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Governors of an entity have the kinds of rights listed in the definition of “governance interest” by reason of their position with the entity. For a governor to have a “governance interest,” however, requires that the governor also have those rights for a reason other than the governor’s status as such. A manager who is not a member in a limited liability company, for example, will not have a governance interest, but a manager who is a member will have a governance interest arising from the ownership of a membership interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Governor” [(15)]
       </b>
       —This term has been chosen to provide a way of referring to a person who has the authority under an entity’s organic law to make management decisions regarding the entity that is different from any of the existing terms used in connection with particular types of entities. Depending on the type of entity or its organic rules, the governors of an entity may have the power to act on their own authority, or they may be organized as a board or similar group and only have the power to act collectively, and then only through a designated agent. In other words, a person having only the power to bind the organization pursuant to the instruction of the governors is not a governor. Under the organic rules, particularly those of unincorporated entities, most or all of the management decisions may be reserved to the members or partners. Thus, if a manager of a limited liability company were limited to having authority to execute management decisions made by the members and did not have any authority to make independent management decisions, the manager would not be a governor under this definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Interest” [(16)]
       </b>
       —In the usual case, the interest held by an interest holder will include both a governance interest and a distributional interest. Members in nonprofit corporations or unincorporated nonprofit associations generally do not have any distributional interest because they do not receive distributions, but they nonetheless may hold a governance interest in which case they would have the status of interest holders under this article.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Interest exchange” [(17)]
       </b>
       —The term “interest exchange” means a transaction authorized by Part 3 pursuant to which an entity may acquire interests in another entity. The consideration that may be provided to the interest holders whose interests are being acquired in an exchange may consist in whole or part of interests in a third party that is not one of the two parties to the exchange itself.
    See
    Section 1131(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Interest holder” [(18)]
       </b>
       —This act does not refer to “equity” interests or “equity” owners or holders because the term “equity” could be confusing in the case of a nonprofit entity whose members do not have an interest in the assets or results of operations of the entity but have only a right to vote on its internal affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Interest holder liability” [(19)]
       </b>
       —This term is used to describe the vicarious liability of an interest holder, by virtue of being an interest holder, for liabilities of the entity. The term includes only personal liability of an interest holder for a debt of the entity imposed on the interest holder either by statute or by the organic rules to the extent authorized pursuant to the organic law. Liabilities that an interest holder incurs in any other fashion are not interest holder liabilities for purposes of this act. Thus, for example, if a state’s business corporation law makes shareholders personally liable for unpaid wages because of their status as shareholders, that liability would be an “interest holder liability.” If, on the other hand, a shareholder were to guarantee payment of an obligation of a corporation, that liability would not be an “interest holder liability” because it is a direct liability and not based on the status of being a shareholder. Similarly, the liability to return an improper distribution is not an interest holder liability because it is a direct liability of the interest holder based on receipt of the distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Merger” [(20)]
       </b>
       —The term means a transaction in which two or more entities are combined into a single entity pursuant to a filing with the filing office. The term “merger” in this act includes the transaction known as a consolidation in which a new entity results from the combination of two or more pre-existing entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Merging entity” [(21)]
       </b>
       —The term “merging entity” refers to each entity that is in existence immediately before a merger and is a party to the merger. It will include the surviving entity if the surviving entity exists before the merger becomes effective. It does not include an entity that provides consideration to be received by interest holders if that entity is not a party to the merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Organic law” [(22)]
       </b>
       —Organic law means statutes that govern the internal affairs of an entity. For example, this act is the organic law of a limited partnership formed under this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Entity laws in a few states purport to require that some of their internal governance rules applicable to a domestic entity also apply to a foreign entity with significant ties to the state.
    See, e.g
    ., CAL. CORP. CODE § 2115 (Foreign Corporations); N.Y. NOT-FOR-PROFIT CORP. §§ 1318-21 (Liabilities of Directors and Officers of Foreign Corporations); 15 PA. CONS. STAT. § 6145 (Applicability of Certain Safeguards to Foreign Corporations). Such a “sticky fingers” law is not included within the definition of “organic law” for purposes of this act because those laws are not part of the law of the entity’s jurisdiction of formation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Organic rules” [(23)]
       </b>
       —The term “organic rules” means an entity’s public organic record and the private organic rules. The organic rules, together with this act, the organic law, and the common law, provide the rules governing the internal affairs of the entity. For example, this act and the partnership agreement comprise the organic rules of a limited partnership formed under this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Plan” [(24)]
       </b>
       —The term “plan” is a short-hand way of referring to the plan of merger, interest exchange, conversion, or domestication, as the case may be, depending on which form of transaction is taking place.
    See
    Sections 1122 (plan of merger), 1132 (plan of interest exchange), 1142 (plan of conversion), 1152 (plan of domestication).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Private organic rules” [(29)]
       </b>
       —The term private “organic rules” is intended to include all governing rules of an entity that are binding on all of its interest holders, whether or not in record form, except for the provisions of the entity’s public organic record, if any. The term is intended to include agreements in “record” form such as corporate bylaws, as well as oral partnership agreements and oral operating agreements among LLC members.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        “Protected agreement” [(30)]

       —The term “protected agreement” refers to evidences of indebtedness and agreements binding on the entity or any of its governors or interest holders that are unpaid or executory in whole or in part on the effective date of the act. Thus, a revolving line of credit from a bank to a corporation would constitute a protected agreement even if advances were not made until after the effective date of the act. Likewise, a partnership agreement in effect under this act or a predecessor to this act is a “protected agreement.”
      </p>
      <p>
       If a protected agreement has provisions that apply if an entity merges, those provisions will apply if the entity enters into an interest exchange, conversion, or domestication even though the agreement does not mention those other types of transactions.

        “Public organic record” [(31)]
       </b>
       —A “public organic record” is a record that is filed publicly to form, organize, incorporate, or otherwise create an entity. The term does not include a statement of authority filed under UPA (1997) (Last Amended 2013) § 303 or any of the other statements that may be filed under that act since those statements do not create a new entity. The same is true for statements filed under this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the same reason, a statement of qualification filed under UPA (1997) (Last Amended 2013) § 1001 is not a “public organic record.” The limited liability partnership that results from the filing is the same entity as the partnership that delivered the statement to the filing office. Similarly, the term does not include a statement of authority filed under section 7 of the Revised Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act (2008) (Last Amended 2013), a statement appointing a registered agent filed under section 31 of that act, or any of the various statements filed under ULLCA (2006) (Last Amended 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       In those states where a deed of trust or other instrument is publicly filed to create a business trust, that filing will constitute a public organic record. But in those states where a business trust is not created by a public filing, the deed of trust or similar record will be part of the private organic rules of the business trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a public organic document has been amended or restated, the term means the public organic document as last amended or restated.

It is sometimes difficult to decide whether one is dealing with a different form of entity or a variation of the same form. For example, a limited partnership, although it has long been characterized or even defined as a partnership, is a different type of entity from a general partnership, while a limited liability partnership is not a different type of entity from a general partnership. In some states cooperatives are categories of business corporations or nonprofit corporations, while in other states cooperatives are a separate type of entity.

       This section preserves existing regulatory law in an adopting state in general terms.
       Adopting states should consider more carefully integrating this act with their various regulatory
       laws. For example, in some states certain professions are limited in their use of limited liability
       entities.
    See
    Section 1103.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws other than this act that will apply to transactions under the act include, for example,
       uniform fraudulent transfer and fraudulent conveyance acts, state insolvency statutes, federal
       bankruptcy law, and Articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —Many states have enacted “antitakeover” statutes intended to make it
       more difficult to acquire control of a publicly traded corporation. Those statutes often provide
       that their application to a particular corporation cannot be changed unless the corporation obtains
       certain specified approvals, such as a vote of disinterested directors or a supermajority vote by
       the shareholders. The purpose of the special requirements in this subsection on varying the
       application of an antitakeover statute is to protect against a hostile acquirer or group of
       shareholders seeking to use the act to avoid the application of the antitakeover statute.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection protects the application of antitakeover statutes from being affected by a
       transaction under this act by requiring that the transaction be approved in a manner that would be
       sufficient to approve changing the application of the antitakeover statute. If a transaction is approved in that manner, there is no policy reason to prohibit the application of the antitakeover
       statute from being varied by a transaction under this act. If the application of an antitakeover
       statute cannot be varied by action of an entity subject to it, then a transaction under this act will
       be permissible only if the antitakeover provision continues to apply after the transaction or the
       transaction itself is permissible under the antitakeover statute.

        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —Because at least some of the provisions of this act will be new in most states, it is likely that existing state laws that require regulatory approval of transactions by businesses such as banks, insurance companies, or public utilities may not be worded in a fashion that will include at least some of the transactions authorized by this act. The purpose of this subsection is to ensure that transactions under this act will be subject to the same regulatory approval as mergers. This subsection is based on whether a merger by a regulated entity requires prior approval because the transactions authorized by this act may be effectuated indirectly in many cases under existing law by establishing a wholly owned subsidiary of the desired type and then merging into it.
      </p>
      <p>

        Subsection (b)

       —This act applies generally to nonprofit corporations and unincorporated nonprofit associations. As in the case of laws regulating particular industries, a state’s laws governing the nondiversion of charitable property to other uses may not cover some of the transactions authorized by this act. To prevent the procedures in this act from being used to avoid restrictions on the use of property held by nonprofit entities, this subsection requires approval of the effect of transactions under this act by the appropriate arm of government having supervision of nonprofit entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       An approval or order obtained under this section may impose conditions or specify the disposition of assets or liabilities in a manner different than would otherwise be the case. In such an instance, the approval or order will control over the provisions of this act specifying the effects of a transaction.

    Sections 1126 (effect of merger), 1136 (effect of interest exchange), 1146 (effect of conversion), 1156 (effect of domestication).

      <p>
       In corporate law, appraisal rights developed when corporate statutes were amended to
       permit mergers with less than unanimous consent of the shareholders. This article provides no
       appraisal rights, because, as a default rule, transactions under this article require the consent or
       affirmative vote of all the partners. Where the limited partnership agreement changes this default
       rule, parties may wish to consider contractual appraisal rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection validates the grant of such contractual appraisal rights.
    Cf
    . 6 Del. Code
       §§ 15-120 (general partnerships), 17-212 (limited partnerships), 18-210 (limited liability
       companies) (validating “contractual appraisal rights”); MBCA § 13.02(5) (permitting the articles
       of incorporation, bylaws, or a resolution of the board of directors to confer appraisal rights in
       contexts in which they would otherwise not be available). Legislative authorization in this
       subsection of the grant of contractual appraisal rights removes any question as to whether a court
       would have jurisdiction to hear a case in which the parties were attempting to create jurisdiction
       in the court by private agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this section, the term “appraisal rights” refers to any arrangement, either in the limited
       partnership agreement or the plan, providing for the buy-out of partners that object to a
       transaction under this article.

       The merger transaction authorized by this act involves the combination of one or more domestic limited partnerships with or into one or more other domestic or foreign entities. It also contemplates the consolidation of two or more foreign entities into a single domestic limited partnership. Upon the effective date of the merger, all the assets and liabilities of the constituent entities vest in the surviving entity as a matter of law. As such, mergers require the existence of at least two separate entities before the transaction and only one entity may survive the merger. If independent existence of the constituent entities is desired following the conclusion of the transaction, a restructuring transaction other than a merger must be used to accomplish the transfer of assets and liabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       This act authorizes a merger for state entity law purposes. Federal law and other state law
       will independently determine how a merger transaction will be taxed.
      </p>

       <b>
        Subsection (a)(1)
       </b>
       —This paragraph states the general rule that subject to Subsection (b) one or more domestic limited partnerships may merge with or into a domestic or foreign
       surviving entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —This paragraph provides that two or more foreign entities may merge into a domestic surviving limited partnership so long as the requirements of Subsection (b) are met.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides that a foreign entity may be a party to a merger or may be the surviving entity in a merger only if the merger is authorized by the laws of the foreign entity’s jurisdiction of formation.

        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection states the requirements for the plan of merger. They are similar to plan of merger provisions in corporation statutes.
       See
    MBCA § 11.02(c). The requirements stated in this subsection are mandatory.
       <i>
        See
       </i>
       Section 105(c)(16).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(1)
       </b>
       —This paragraph requires that the plan of merger identify the parties to the merger. The name of a merging entity as it appears in the plan of merger will be its name in its jurisdiction of formation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(3)
       </b>
       —The language of this paragraph is similar to Model Business Corporation Act section 11.02(c)(3). What may be done under this paragraph with respect to providing for continuing interests in the surviving entity for some holders of interests of a class or series of a party to the merger while paying some other form of consideration to other holders
       of the same class or series of interests in that entity will vary depending on the type of entity
       involved and the extent to which its organic rules provide for non-uniform treatment of interest holders in a manner that is permissible under its organic law. Similarly, the ability to use a merger to reorganize the capital structure of the surviving entity will vary depending on the type of entity involved and whether the entity has appropriately adopted relevant provisions in its organic rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the organic law and organic rules of an unincorporated entity permit a non-uniform “equity shuffle” to be accomplished in a merger involving the unincorporated entity, the minority owners of the unincorporated entity will not necessarily be entitled to the statutory appraisal rights currently afforded to minority stockholders in merging corporate entities. Any perceived
       unfairness in the shuffle would be addressed either: (i) under principles of fiduciary duties and the contractual obligations of good faith and fair dealing, assuming, of course, that such duties and obligations have not been contractually modified or eliminated to the extent permitted by the applicable organic law; or (ii) by the exercise of whatever rights the minority owners may have to veto the transaction or to withdraw or to dissociate and be paid the value of their interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Model Business Corporation Act generally requires that shares of the same class or series be treated in the same manner in a merger unless the corporation has adopted an applicable provision of its articles of incorporation pursuant to section 6.01(e) of that act providing for variations in the treatment of holders of the same class or series of shares. Thus, a determination
       of what may be done by way of an equity shuffle in the case of a corporation will require reference to its organic law and organic rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       The consideration paid to the interest holders of the merging parties may be supplied in
       whole or part by a person who is not a party to the merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides the statutory authority for a merging party to include a provision in a plan of merger that is not specifically listed in Subsection (a). One such possibility is contractual appraisal rights as provided in Section 1106(2).

       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —In the uniform acts pertaining to unincorporated business organizations, unanimity is the default rule for approving a merger. The limited partnership agreement certainly can change this rule, but care should be taken in doing so. For example, a merger can revise the partnership agreement. Section 1122(a)(4). Thus, if a merger requires less-than-unanimous consent, the partnership agreement is subject to amendment by the same quantum of consent. “Exit rights” also require consideration. This act does not provide appraisal rights, because such rights are inapposite when unanimous consent is required.
    See
    Section 1106, cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —This provision is not a default rule, Section 105(c)(16), and deals with the situation in which a partner of a limited partnership that is a party to a merger will have vicarious liability for the liabilities of the surviving entity that are incurred after the merger has become effective. The special approval requirement in Subsection (a)(2) will be applicable; for example, to partners of a limited partnership that merges into a general partnership that is not a limited liability partnership if the partners become general partners of the surviving general partnership.
      </p>
      <p>
       The consent of a partner required by Subsection (a)(2)(B) may be given either by: (i) signing or agreeing generally to the terms of a partnership agreement that includes the required provision permitting less than unanimous approval of a merger in which partners become subject to “interest holder liability”; or (ii) voting for or consenting to an amendment to the partnership agreement to add such a provision.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —Where a domestic entity other than a limited partnership is a party to a merger under this act, this subsection defers to that entity’s organic law for the requirements for approval of the merger by that entity.

        Subsection (c)

       —Where a foreign entity is a party to a merger under this act, this subsection defers to the laws of the foreign jurisdiction for the requirements for approval of the merger by the foreign entity. Those laws will include the organic law of the foreign entity and other applicable laws. The laws of the foreign jurisdiction will also control the application of any special approval requirements found in the organic rules of the foreign entity.

      <p>
       The filing of a statement of merger makes the transaction a matter of public record.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection pertains to all merging entities involved in a merger, not merely any merging domestic limited partnership. Other filings may be required by the organic law of other entities participating in the merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1) and (2)
       </b>
       —The names of foreign entities set forth in the statement of merger will generally be their names in their jurisdiction of formation, except that if a foreign entity has been required to adopt a different name in order to register to do business in this state, the foreign qualification statute will likely require that, when the entity does business in this state, the entity must use the name adopted for the purposes of registering to do business. Engaging in a merger under this act will be part of the business done by the entity in this state and the name of the entity set forth in the statement of merger will thus need to be the name under which the entity has registered to do business. Use of the name under which the entity has registered to do business will allow the records in the filing office to associate the registration of the entity to do business with the statement of merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(3)
       </b>
       —
    See
    Subsection (f), cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(4)
       </b>
       —The statement in this paragraph that the plan of merger was approved by each entity in accordance with this article necessarily presupposes that the plan was approved in accordance with any valid, special requirements in the organic rules of each merging entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(5) and (6)
       </b>
       —The public organic record of a domestic surviving entity created by the merger that is attached to the statement of merger becomes the original, officially filed text of the public organic record of the surviving entity when the statement of merger takes effect. It is not necessary, or appropriate, to make any other filing to create the surviving entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, a statement of qualification for a domestic limited liability partnership created by the merger that is attached to the statement of merger does not need to be filed separately.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —Organic laws typically require that an initial filing that creates an entity be signed by the person serving as the incorporator or other organizer. This subsection, however, provides that the public organic record of the surviving entity does not need to be signed since the record is attached to a signed record.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subsection also permits the public organic record of the surviving entity to omit any provision that is not required to be included in a restatement of the public organic record. Pursuant to this provision, for example, the public organic record of a business corporation created as the surviving entity in the merger would not need to state the name and address of each incorporator even though that information would be required by section 2.02(a)(4) of the Model Business Corporation Act if the corporation were being incorporated outside the context of the merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —A plan of merger that contains all the information required in the statement of merger may be filed instead of the statement of merger. The plan must be in a record and signed by each merging party.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f)
       </b>
       —A merger in which the surviving entity is a domestic limited partnership takes effect when the statement of merger takes effect. A merger in which the surviving entity is a foreign entity will usually also take effect when the statement of merger takes effect because the practice is to coordinate the filings that need to be made when a merger involves both a domestic entity and also a foreign entity so that the filings in each jurisdiction take effect at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, when the surviving limited partnership is a foreign limited partnership, it is possible that the filing in the foreign jurisdiction will take effect at a different time. For that reason, this subsection provides that the merger will take effect at the later of: (i) when the statement of merger takes effect; and (ii) when the merger takes effect under the law of the foreign jurisdiction. This rule avoids the possibility that the merger will take effect in this state before it takes effect in the foreign jurisdiction, which would produce the undesirable result that the merging domestic limited partnership would cease to appear as an active entity on the records of this state before the records of the foreign jurisdiction reflect a completed merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is only necessary for the filing office to record the effective date of the statement of merger and the filing office does not need to be concerned with the effective date of the merger itself. Persons wishing to determine the effective date of a merger involving both a domestic and a foreign entity will be able to do so by consulting the records of the filing offices in each jurisdiction.

      </h4>
      <p>
       With the exception of Subsections (c) and (d), this section is similar to statutory provisions on the effect of a merger of a corporation with a corporation.
    See
    MBCA § 11.07.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection states the general understanding that in a merger the assets and liabilities of the merging entities automatically vest in the surviving entity. The surviving entity becomes the owner of all real and personal property of the merged entities and is subject to all debts, obligations, and liabilities of the merging entities. A merger does not constitute a transfer, assignment, or conveyance of any property held by the merging entities before the merger. A merger also does not give rise to a claim that a contract with a merging entity is no longer in effect on the ground of nonassignability, unless the contract specifically provides that it does not survive a merger. The contract rights that are vested in the surviving entity include the right to enforce subscription agreements for interests and obligations to make capital contributions entered into or incurred before the merger.
    See
    Section 1103(c) (dealing with the surviving entity’s rights in trust obligations of a nonsurviving party in a merger and transactions such as bequests made to a nonsurviving party to a merger that take effect after the merger).
      </p>
      <p>
       After a merger becomes effective, the law of the surviving entity’s jurisdiction of formation governs the surviving entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sections 1103(a) and (b)modify the provisions of this section with respect to the effects of a merger to the extent a regulatory law provides otherwise or any of the parties holds property committed to charitable purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —A merger cannot have the effect of making an interest holder of a domestic merging entity subject to interest holder liability for the debts, obligations, or other liabilities of any other person or entity unless the interest holder has signed a separate written consent to become subject to such liability or previously agreed to the effectuation of a transaction having that effect without the interest holder’s consent. The partnership agreement cannot change this provision. Section 105(c)(16).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(7)
       </b>
       —All pending proceedings involving either the survivor or a party whose separate existence ceased as a result of the merger are continued. Under this paragraph, the name of the survivor may be, but need not be, substituted in any pending proceeding for the name of a party to the merger whose separate existence ceased as a result of the merger. The substitution may be made whether the survivor is a complainant or a respondent, and may be made at the instance of either the survivor or an opposing party. Such a substitution has no substantive effect because, whether or not the survivor’s name is substituted, the survivor succeeds to the claims, and is subject to the liabilities, of any party to the merger whose separate existence ceased as a result of the merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(8)(B)
       </b>
       —The private organic rules of an unincorporated entity typically may be either oral or written. The plan of merger is not required to set forth amendments to oral provisions of the private organic rules of the surviving entity, and thus this provision is limited in scope to amendments to the private organic rules that are to be in a record, if any.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(10)
       </b>
       —
    See
    Section 1106, cmts.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsections (c) and (d)
       </b>
       —These subsections set forth rules for two circumstances that typically do not exist in a merger where all the entities involved are corporations. Subsection (c) deals with the situation where an interest holder that does not have vicarious liability for the obligations of a merging entity before the merger has interest holder liability after the merger. An example would be a corporate shareholder who agrees to be the general partner in a limited partnership that is the surviving entity in a merger between a corporation and a limited partnership that is not a limited liability limited partnership. Subsection (d) deals with the situation where an interest holder has vicarious liability for the obligations of one of the merging parties before the merger but ceases to have any interest holder liability for the obligations of the surviving entity after the merger has become effective. An example would be a general partner in a general partnership that merges into a corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effects of Subsections (c) and (d) will depend on when a liability is incurred, which is determined by other law. For a discussion of the issue, see Section 404(c), cmt. (The Temporal Nexus – When Claim Incurred).
      </p>
      <p>
       These subsections apply not only to merging domestic limited partnerships but also to any other domestic entity involved in the merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This subsection sets forth the general rule that an interest holder that was not liable for the liabilities of a merging entity before the merger but will have personal liability for the obligations of the surviving entity after the merger will be personally liable only for the liabilities of a domestic surviving entity that are incurred after the effective date of a merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides four rules with respect to an interest holder who ceases to have interest holder liability after the effective date of the merger:

       </b>
       —When a merger becomes effective, this subsection provides that a foreign entity that is the surviving entity may be served with process in this state. The proceedings covered by this subsection include a proceeding to enforce the rights of any interest holders of each domestic merging entity who are entitled to and exercise appraisal rights. One of the liabilities that a foreign surviving entity succeeds to is the obligation of a merging entity to pay the amount, if any, to which its interest holders who assert appraisal rights are entitled.

      <p>
       An interest exchange is the same type of transaction as the share exchange provided for in section 11.03 of the Model Business Corporation Act. The effect of an interest exchange is that: (i) the separate existence of the acquired entity is not affected; and (ii) the acquiring entity acquires all of the interests of one or more classes of the acquired entity. An interest exchange also allows an indirect acquisition through the use of consideration in the exchange that is not provided by the acquiring entity (
    e.g.,
    consideration from another or related entity).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither share exchanges nor interest exchanges are universally recognized in either corporation or unincorporated entity laws. The effect of an interest exchange can be achieved through a triangular merger in which the acquiring entity forms a new subsidiary and the acquired entity is then merged into the new subsidiary. Part 3 allows the interest exchange to be accomplished directly in a single step, rather than indirectly through the triangular merger route.
      </p>
      <p>
       The “series” referenced in Subsection (a) are not the series contemplated by the Uniform Statutory Entity Trust Act §§ 401-405 and some LLC statutes.
       See, e.g.,
    Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, § 18-215 (2012);
       805 ILL. COMP. STAT. 180/37-40 (2012). Instead, in this context “series” refers to a subset of a class, which is a meaning commonly found in corporation law.
       <i>
        See, e.g.,
       </i>
       MBCA § 6.02. Specific provisions authorizing classes and series are less common in unincorporated entity law but do exist.
       <i>
        See, e.g.,
       </i>
       MINN. STAT. § 322B.155 (2012). In any event, a partnership agreement certainly has the power to create classes and series as contemplated by this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —For this section to apply, a domestic limited partnership must be either the acquiring or acquired entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The acquiring entity is not required to acquire all of the interests in the acquired entity. For example, assume that a limited partnership with three classes of limited partner interests enters into an interest exchange with an acquiring entity. The acquiring entity need only acquire all of the ownership interests of one or more classes of the limited partner interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection allows a foreign entity to effectuate an interest exchange with a domestic limited partnership if the interest exchange is authorized by the organic law of the foreign entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This subsection deals with rights of parties to protected agreements (defined in Section 1101(30)) when an interest exchange takes place. Because the concept of an interest exchange is relatively new, a person contracting with a domestic limited partnership or loaning it money who drafted and negotiated special rights relating to the transaction before the enactment of this article should not be charged with the consequences of not having dealt with the concept of an interest exchange in the context of those special rights. Similarly, when the governance structure of an entity has been negotiated before the enactment of this act, the concept of an interest exchange may not have been reflected in any special governance arrangements; for example, special approval rights may have been provided for fundamental transactions, but those rights fail to include language that would make them applicable to an interest exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accordingly, this subsection provides a transitional rule that is intended to protect such special rights. If, for example, a limited partnership is a party to a contract that provides that the entity cannot participate in a merger without the consent of the other party to the contract, the requirement to obtain the consent of the other party will also apply to an interest exchange in which the entity is the acquired entity. If the limited partnership fails to obtain the consent, the result will be that the other party will have the same rights it would have had if the entity were to participate in a merger without the required consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The transitional rule in this subsection ceases to make sense at such time as the provisions of the agreement giving rise to the special rights are first amended after the effective date of this article because at that time the provision may be amended to address expressly an interest exchange. The transitional rule will continue to apply, however, if a provision other than the specific provisions giving rise to the special rights is amended.

      <p>
       This section applies only when the
    acquired
    entity is a domestic limited partnership, and this part states no rule for the effect of an interest exchange when the only domestic limited partnership involved is the
       <i>
        acquiring
       </i>
       entity. For that situation, the other provisions of this act must be consulted, because this act is the organic law of the acquiring entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —In contrast to a merger, an interest exchange does not in and of itself affect the separate existence of the parties, vest in the acquiring entity the assets of the acquired entity, or render the acquiring entity liable for the liabilities of the acquired entity. Thus, Subsection (a) is significantly simpler than Section 1126(a) with respect to the effects of a merger.
      </p>
      <p>
       When an interest exchange becomes effective: (i) the interests of the acquired domestic limited partnership are exchanged, converted, or canceled as provided in the plan; (ii) the only rights of the former partners and transferees of the acquired limited partnership whose interests are affected by the interest exchange are those rights related to the exchange, conversion, or cancellation; (iii) the acquiring entity becomes the owner of the acquired limited partnership’s interests as provided in the plan; (iv) the certificate of limited partnership of the acquired limited partnership is amended as provided in the statement of interest exchange, thus obviating the need for repetitive filings (
    i.e
    ., a filing as to the entity interest exchange and another filing to reflect amendments to certificate); and (v) the provisions of the partnership agreement of the acquired limited partnership that are to be in a record, if any, are amended to the extent provided in the plan of interest exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c)
       </b>
       —This subsection provides the rule for future interest holder liability pertaining to domestic entities and parallels analogous provisions in Parts 2 (mergers), 4 (conversions), and 5 (domestications).
    See
    Section 1126, cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d)

       This part of Article 11 permits an entity to change to a different type of entity. A transaction in which an entity changes its jurisdiction of organization but does not change its type is a domestication and is the subject of Part 5.

       <b>
        Subsection (a)(2)
       </b>
       —For this provision to apply, this type of conversion must be authorized by the law of the foreign jurisdiction. If this is not the case, it may be possible to achieve the same result by forming an entity of the type desired in the foreign jurisdiction and then merging the domestic entity into the new foreign entity under Part 2 of Article 11.

       <b>
        Subsection (b)

When a foreign entity becomes a domestic limited partnership pursuant to this part of Article 11, the effect of the conversion will be as provided in Section 1146. The procedures by which the conversion is approved, however, will be determined by the laws of the foreign entity’s jurisdiction of formation.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section applies regardless of whether a domestic limited partnership is the converting or converted entity. A foreign entity seeking to convert to a domestic limited partnership must therefore comply with this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       If either the converting or converted entity is a foreign entity, the organic law of the foreign entity’s jurisdiction must also be consulted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The filing of a statement of conversion makes the transaction a matter of public record.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection sets forth the requirements for a statement of conversion. They are essentially the same as the requirements for a statement of merger in Section 1125.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —A plan of conversion can be used as a substitute for the statement of conversion so long as the plan satisfies the requirements in Subsection (b).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f)
       </b>
       —Section 207 determines when a record delivered for filing under this act becomes effective. A statement of conversion may specify a delayed effective time and date, subject to the ninety-day limit stated in Section 207(3) and (4).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the statement of conversion becomes effective under this subsection, the conversion transaction occurs if the converted entity is a domestic limited partnership. A conversion in which the converted entity is a foreign entity will usually also take effect when the statement of conversion takes effect because the best practice will be to coordinate the filings that need to be made when a conversion involves both a domestic entity and also a foreign entity so that the filings in each jurisdiction take effect at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, when the converting limited partnership is a foreign limited partnership, it is possible that the filing in the foreign jurisdiction will take effect at a different time. For that reason, this subsection provides that the conversion will take effect at the later of: (i) when the statement of conversion takes effect; and (ii) when the conversion takes effect under the law of the foreign jurisdiction. This rule avoids the possibility that the conversion will take effect in this state before it takes effect in the foreign jurisdiction, which would produce the undesirable result that the converting domestic limited partnership would cease to appear as an active entity on the records of this state before appearing as its active, converted self on the records of the foreign jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is only necessary for the filing office to record the effective date of the statement of conversion and the filing office does not need to be concerned with the effective date of the conversion itself. Persons wishing to determine the effective date of a conversion involving both a domestic limited partnership and a foreign entity will be able to do so by consulting the records of the filing offices in each jurisdiction.

      <p>
       A converted entity is the same entity as it was before the conversion; the entity just has a different legal form.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)
       </b>
       —This subsection states the principal legal effects of a conversion. The converted entity remains the owner of all real and personal property and remains subject to all the liabilities, actual or contingent, of the converted entity. A conversion is not a conveyance, transfer, or assignment. A conversion does not give rise to: (i) claims of reverter or impairment of title based on a prohibited conveyance or transfer; or (ii) to a claim that a contract with the converting entity is no longer in effect on the ground of nonassignability, unless the contract specifically provides that it does not survive a conversion. The contract rights that remain in the converted entity include, without limitation, the right to enforce subscription agreements for interests and obligations to make capital contributions entered into or incurred before the conversion.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a conversion becomes effective, the internal affairs of the converting entity are no longer governed by its former organic law but instead by the organic law of the converted entity. As a result, filings that may have been made under the organic law of the converting entity, such as the following, will no longer be effective: a statement of qualification as a limited liability partnership under UPA (1997) (Last Amended 2013) § 901, a statement of partnership authority under section 303 of that act, a statement of authority under Section of the ULLCA (2006) (Last Amended 2013) § 302, or under Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act (2008) (Last Amended 2013) § 7.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a)(5)
       </b>
       —All pending proceedings involving the converting entity are continued. The name of the converted entity may be, but need not be, substituted in any pending proceeding for the name of the converting entity.

      <p>
       A domestication authorized by Part 5 of Article 11 differs from a conversion in that a domestication requires that the domesticating entity be the same type of entity as the domesticated entity. In a conversion, by contrast, the converting entity changes its type.
      </p>
      <p>
       As with a conversion, all rights and privileges, debts, obligations and other liabilities, and actions or proceedings of a domesticating entity vest unimpaired in the domesticated entity. A domestication is not a sale, transfer, assignment, or conveyance and does not give rise to a claim of reverter or impairment of title.
    See
    Section 1146(a), cmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part 5 of Article 11 governs the legal effect of a foreign limited partnership domesticating in this state. On the other hand, the organic laws of the foreign jurisdiction, and not Part 5, will govern the legal effect of most aspects of a domestication of a domestic limited partnership in another jurisdiction. In the latter scenario, Part 5 authorizes the domestication of the domestic entity in the foreign jurisdiction, but Part 5 does not create a right in the domestic entity to be received in the foreign jurisdiction. Similarly, this section does not provide a right on the part of a foreign limited partnership to become a domestic limited partnership if the domestication is not authorized by the laws of the foreign jurisdiction. If the foreign jurisdiction does not authorize a domestication transaction, the same results can be accomplished by forming a new limited partnership in this state and merging the existing foreign limited partnership into the new domestic limited partnership.

       This section sets forth the requirements for the plan of domestication for a domestic limited partnership seeking to become a limited partnership existing under the law of another jurisdiction. For a foreign limited partnership seeking to become a domestic limited partnership, the organic law of the foreign limited partnership governs the requirements for a plan of domestication. The content of a plan of domestication is similar to the content of a plan of merger.

      <p>
       Regardless of whether a domestic limited partnership is the domesticating or domesticated entity:
      </p>
      <p>
       • This section applies and, therefore, a foreign limited partnership seeking to domesticate and thereby become a domestic limited partnership must comply with this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The organic law of the foreign limited partnership’s jurisdiction must also be consulted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The filing of a statement of domestication makes the transaction a matter of public record.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)
       </b>
       —This subsection sets forth the requirements for a statement of domestication. They are essentially the same as the requirements for a statement of merger in Section 1125.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e)
       </b>
       —A plan of domestication can be used as a substitute for the statement of domestication so long as the plan satisfies the requirements in Subsection (b).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f)
       </b>
       —Section 207 determines when a record delivered for filing under this act becomes effective. A statement of domestication may specify a delayed effective time and date, subject to the ninety-day limit stated in Section 207(3) and (4).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the statement of domestication becomes effective under this subsection, the domestication transaction occurs if the domesticated entity is a domestic limited partnership. A domestication in which the domesticated entity is a foreign limited partnership will usually also take effect when the statement of domestication takes effect because the best practice will be to coordinate the filings that need to be made in each jurisdiction so that they take effect at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, when the domesticated limited partnership is a foreign limited partnership, it is possible that the filing in the foreign jurisdiction will take effect at a different time. For that reason, this subsection provides that the domestication will take effect at the later of: (i) when the statement of domestication takes effect; and (ii) when the domestication takes effect under the law of the foreign jurisdiction. This rule avoids the possibility that the domestication will take effect in this state before it takes effect in the foreign jurisdiction, which would produce the undesirable result that the domesticating domestic limited partnership would cease to appear as an active entity on the records of this state before appearing as its active, domesticated self on the records of the foreign jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is only necessary for the filing office to record the effective date of the statement of domestication and the filing office does not need to be concerned with the effective date of the domestication itself. Persons wishing to determine the effective date of a domestication will be able to do so by consulting the records of the filing offices in each jurisdiction.

       —The interests of the domesticating limited partnership are reclassified into whatever rights were negotiated in the domestication and the partners and transferees of the domesticating limited partnership are only entitled to those rights.

       This section continues prior law after the effective date of this act with respect to rights accrued and proceedings. But for this section, the new law of this act would displace the old laws in some circumstances. The power of a new act to displace the old statute with respect to conduct occurring before the new act’s enactment is substantial. Millard H. Ruud,

       Eventually, this act will apply all to pre-existing limited partnerships—whether by choice under Section 112(a)(2) (permitting an early opt-in), or without choice on the “all-inclusive date.” Section 112(b). In this context, the phrase “before [the effective date of this [act]]” should be understood as referring to the date upon which this act becomes applicable to the particular limited partnership at issue.

While in the possession of the custodian, no material produced shall be available for examination, without the consent of the person who produced the material, other than for legitimate law enforcement purposes pursuant to this chapter. Under any reasonable terms and conditions that the attorney general prescribes, documentary material while in the possession of the custodian shall be available for examination by the person who produced the material or any authorized representatives of the person.

Any designated successor has all duties and responsibilities as to the materials imposed by this chapter on his or her predecessor in office as to them, except that he or she is not responsible for any default or dereliction that occurred before his or her designation as custodian.

The time allowed for compliance with the demand in whole or in part as deemed proper and ordered by the court shall not run during the pendency of the petition in the court.

         Compelled testimony shall not be used against the witness as evidence in any criminal proceedings against him or her in any court. However, the grant of immunity does not immunize the witness from civil liability arising from the transactions about which testimony is given, and he or she may nevertheless be prosecuted or subjected to penalty or forfeiture for any perjury, false swearing, or contempt committed in answering or in failing to answer or in producing evidence or failing to do so in accordance with the order. If a person refuses to testify after being granted immunity from prosecution and after being ordered to testify, he or she may be adjudged in civil contempt by the superior court until any time that he or she purges him or herself of contempt by testifying, producing documentary material or presenting written answers as ordered. The above does not prevent the attorney general from instituting other appropriate contempt proceedings against any person who violates any of the above provisions.

If the limited-liability company agreement does not specify the manner of authorizing a conversion of the limited-liability company or a merger or consolidation that involves the limited-liability company as a constituent party and does not prohibit a conversion of the limited-liability company, the conversion shall be authorized by the approval by the members or, if there is more than one class or group of members, then by each class or group of members, in either case, by members who own more than fifty percent (50%) of the then-current percentage or other interest in the profits of the domestic limited-liability company owned by all of the members or by the members in each class or group, as appropriate.
